      PubMed Publication Tracking highlights scholarship generated using the OMOP Common Data Model, OHDSI tools, or the OHDSI network. These publications represent scientific accomplishments across areas of data standards, methodological research, open-source development, and clinical applications. We provide the resource to search and browse the catalogue of OHDSI-related publications by date, author, title, journal, and SNOMED terms. We monitor the impact of our community using summary statistics (number of publications and citations), and the growth and diversity of our community with the number of distinct authors. Searches for new papers are performed daily, and citation counts are updated monthy.
