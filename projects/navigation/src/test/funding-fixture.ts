    "0":"The National Library of Medicine (NLM) supports innovative research and development in biomedical informatics and data science. This funding opportunity focuses on biomedical discovery and data-powered health, integrating streams of complex and interconnected research outputs that can be translated into scientific insights, clinical care, public health practices, and personal wellness to ensure the research is scalable, reproducible, and generalizable. The scope of NLM's interest in these research domains is broad, with emphasis on new and innovative methods and approaches to foster data driven discovery in the biomedical and clinical health sciences as well as domain-independent, scalable, and reusable approaches to discovery, curation, analysis, organization, and management of health-related data and digital objects.",
    "1":"The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to invite exploratory\/developmental research grant applications (R21) for innovative informatics methods and algorithms to improve the acquisition, analysis, visualization, or interpretation of data across the cancer research continuum including cancer biology, cancer treatment and diagnosis, early cancer detection, risk assessment and prevention, cancer control and epidemiology, and\/or cancer health disparities. As a component of the NCI's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) Program, the emphasis of this FOA is on supporting the development of novel informatics capabilities that involve a high degree of innovation that have the potential to accelerate or enhance research. To be successful, there must be a clear rationale for how the proposed informatics method or algorithm is novel and how it will benefit the cancer research field. Projects proposing the application of existing methods or algorithms where the novelty resides in the biological or clinical question being pursued are not responsive to this solicitation and will not be reviewed.",
    "2":"The goal of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to advance surveillance science by supporting the development of new and innovative tools and methods for more efficient, detailed, timely, and accurate data collection by cancer registries. Specifically, the FOA seeks applications for projects to develop, adapt, apply, scale-up, and validate tools and methods to improve the collection and integration cancer registry data and to expand the data items collected. Applications must be built on partnership with U.S. population-based central cancer registries (a partnership must involve at least two different registries). Tools and methods proposed for development are expected to enhance the registry core infrastructure and, in so doing, expand the usefulness of registry-collected data to support high-quality cancer research.",
    "3":"This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) seeks to support research that examines the impact of leveraging health information technology (health IT) to reduce disparities in access to and utilization of health care services, patient-clinician communication, and health outcomes for populations that experience health disparities in the U.S.",
    "4":"The Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program aims to harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance.Many NSF-funded projects result in publicly accessible, modifiable, and distributable open-source products, including software, hardware, models, specifications, programming languages, or data platforms, that catalyze further innovation. In some cases, an open-source product that shows potential for wide adoption forms the basis for a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (OSE) that comprises a leadership team; a managing organization with a well-defined governance structure and distributed development model; a cohesive community of external intellectual content developers; and a broad base of users across academia, industry, and government. The overarching vision of POSE is that proactive and intentional formation of managing organizations will ensure a broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products; increased coordination of external intellectual content developer contributions; and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact. Toward this end, the POSE program supports the formation of new OSE managing organizations based on an existing open-source product or class of products, whereby each organization is responsible for the creation and management of processes and infrastructure needed for the efficient and secure development and maintenance of an OSE.
