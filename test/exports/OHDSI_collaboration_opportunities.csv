3/1/2023,https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/home/getfilebytoken/dpG5pjV5yCew8fXvctFJNK,DRAFT: Depression and Suicide Risk in Adults: Screening,USPSTF,"For depression screening, there is still uncertainty about the benefits of screening in older adults, 
and studies are needed that report outcomes using instruments specifically designed for older 
Depression, Anxiety, and Suicide Risk in Adults 81 Kaiser Permanente EPC
adults, and both short-term (<6-month) and long-term (2 years or more) outcomes. There are also 
limitations to our understanding of the direct impact of screening relative to other depression 
management supports. As depression screening becomes the standard of care, this is increasingly 
difficult to study. Nevertheless, rigorous examination of implementation programs are needed 
that report the percent of patients being screened, referred, and treated as well as patient health 
outcomes such as depression symptoms and quality of life, prior to program implementation and 
in control clinics. In addition, more research is needed to understand the impact of depression 
screening and most appropriate tools among Black, Latinx, Asian-American, and Native 
American/Alaska Native communities. Native Americans/Alaska Native communities were not 
represented in the included studies, despite disproportionately high depression prevalence."
3/1/2023,https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/home/getfilebytoken/dpG5pjV5yCew8fXvctFJNK,DRAFT: Depression and Suicide Risk in Adults: Screening,USPSTF,"More information is needed on screening in other underrepresented groups such as 
gender non-conforming, immigrant, and non-English speaking communities. Relatedly, research 
is needed on whether implicit bias among primary care clinicians is associated with lower 
likelihood of screening some patients or the likelihood of appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
For anxiety screening, more studies are needed on the diagnostic accuracy of screening tools that 
are feasible for use in primary care settings, tested among primary care patients or similar 
populations, using valid reference standards, and determining (and replicating) optimal cut-offs 
for any anxiety disorder. Additionally, more studies are needed that specifically address panic 
disorder and social anxiety disorder, where evidence was the weakest."
3/1/2023,https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/home/getfilebytoken/dpG5pjV5yCew8fXvctFJNK,DRAFT: Depression and Suicide Risk in Adults: Screening,USPSTF,"The evidence base to support broad suicide screening in primary care settings is extremely 
limited. Foundational research is needed in primary care populations, including determining 
which tools should be used and how screening should be implemented. For example, what 
training is needed and for whom, what system-level supports are needed, and how to minimize 
the risk of harms such as feeling judged or stigmatized, feeling that a cry for help was ignored, or 
suffering unnecessary loss of autonomy. We support the NIMH call for research examining the 
use of the Zero Suicide approach described above under “Suicide prevention treatment.” Patients 
who are considering suicide are seen in primary care settings on a regular basis, but it is 
important to determine what approaches are effective in helping these patients before making 
recommendations."
