",National Science Foundation,"Large-scale simulations and the ability to accumulate massive amounts of data have revolutionized science and engineering. The goal of the Computational and Data-enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) meta-program is to identify and capitalize on opportunities for major scientific and engineering breakthroughs through new computational and data-analysis approaches and best practices. The CDS&E meta-program supports projects that harness computation and data to advance knowledge and accelerate discovery above and beyond the goals of the participating individual programs. The intellectual drivers may be in an individual discipline or cut across more than one discipline in various Divisions and Directorates. A CDS&E proposal should enable and/or utilize the development and adaptation of advances in research and infrastructure in computational and data science.
The CDS&E meta-program encourages research that pushes the envelope of science and engineering through computation and data, welcoming proposals in any research area supported by the participating divisions. A proposal may address topics that develop or enable interactions among theory, computing, experiment, and observation to achieve progress on hitherto intractable science and engineering problems. Areas of emphasis for CDS&E vary by program. PIs are advised to consult the ""related programs"" links below before submitting.
The CDS&E meta-program is not intended to replace existing programs that support projects involving computation or the analysis of large or complex data sets using established methods. Rather, proposals submitted to the CDS&E meta-program must have a significant component of computational or data science that goes well beyond what would typically be included in these programs.Any proposal submitted to the CDS&E program that is not responsive to this Program Description may be transferred to or reviewed within the context of an individual program. A proposal requesting consideration within the context of CDS&E should begin the title with the identifying acronym ""CDS&E:"". Supplement requests to existing awards may also be considered. A CDS&E proposal should include substantive science, engineering, or computing research. Algorithm and pilot software development supporting science and engineering may also be appropriate, depending on the program. Proposers who seek to implement proven, existing methods into robust cyberinfrastructure are referred instead to the program on Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI).
A CDS&E proposal should be submitted to one of the ""Related Programs"" or Divisions by the associated submission window, deadline, or target date listed in the table below. In picking the most relevant program, PIs are advised to read program descriptions and solicitations carefully and consult with cognizant Program Officers before proposal preparation.

This U01 will be competed and funded to: 1) obtain existing prevention trial data sets, with collaboration of the PIs who have the original data sets; 2) anonymize and aggregate and harmonize prevention trial data sets; 3) provide methodological and statistical expertise needed to examine, using theory-based approaches, whether intervening early reduces risk for STB and mortality, and potential mediators and moderators; and 4) oversee a final harmonized prevention trial data that will be deposited into the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). This harmonized dataset will serve as an ongoing resource to the research community for years to come.",https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=346441,Application budgets should reflect the actual needs of the proposed project. ,4 years,2023-10-10,,

2023-02-03,Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) | NSF - National Science Foundation,"23-556, Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems",National Science Foundation,"The Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program aims to harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance.Many NSF-funded projects result in publicly accessible, modifiable, and distributable open-source products, including software, hardware, models, specifications, programming languages, or data platforms, that catalyze further innovation. In some cases, an open-source product that shows potential for wide adoption forms the basis for a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (OSE) that comprises a leadership team; a managing organization with a well-defined governance structure and distributed development model; a cohesive community of external intellectual content developers; and a broad base of users across academia, industry, and government. The overarching vision of POSE is that proactive and intentional formation of managing organizations will ensure a broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products; increased coordination of external intellectual content developer contributions; and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact. Toward this end, the POSE program supports the formation of new OSE managing organizations based on an existing open-source product or class of products, whereby each organization is responsible for the creation and management of processes and infrastructure needed for the efficient and secure development and maintenance of an OSE.
