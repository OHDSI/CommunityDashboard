2025-10-01,www.grants.gov,NSF 25-548: Accelerating Research Translation (ART),U.S. National Science Foundation,"The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) seeks to increase the scale and pace of advancing discoveries resulting from academic research into tangible solutions that benefit the public. The overarching goal for the Accelerating Research Translation (ART) program is to advance the U.S. scientific and economic leadership by building capacity and increasing the number of robust translational research ecosystems in Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) that span across the full geography of our nation.?Innovations can occur anywhere and can be opportunities for creating sustained impacts in every single region of the United States. Achieving translational outcomes as a mechanism to drive sustained economic impacts is the primary aim of the ""Accelerating Research Translation"" (ART) program.   Led by NSF’s Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP) and in collaboration with other NSF directorates and the Office of Integrative Activities, the ART program seeks proposals involving institutional leadership; research translation programs, institutes or centers; technology transfer offices; units responsible for managing research intellectual property (IP); entrepreneurial training teams; and researchers from all scientific, technological and engineering fields in collaboration with one or more of the other target categories mentioned below.  This updated ART solicitation expands and builds upon its previous version, NSF 23-558, by implementing Tracks that address varying stages of capacity to accelerate research translation.    The ART program is aimed at providing resources that will ultimately facilitate a wide range of IHEs to achieve research translation, accelerate technology transfer, and create sustained economic and collective impacts across the U.S. It is understood that, like technology readiness levels (TRLs), there is no one measure or a combination of measures that can be used to describe the capacity of or measure the research translation readiness level (RTRL) for an IHE.  Some indicators that reflect on RTRL include volume of sustained basic and applied research as measured by research expenditures, robust technology transfer and entrepreneurship related activities (e.g. invention disclosures, patents, licenses, royalties, partnerships with industry, non-profits etc.).  Number of start-ups, resources for entrepreneurial and innovation education and training, the presence of a dedicated technology transfer office are also some of the other indicators that reflect on the RTRL.   Some of the criteria that may help identify the RTRL for an IHE are shown in Figure 1.  Typically, an IHE with low RTRL is likely to have very few patent, licensing, or start-ups related activities, while as these activities will be at a higher level for an IHE with a medium RTRL, whereas an IHE with high RTRL would likely have established tech transfer office with an an extensive record of technology transfer activities including patenting, licensing and creation of  startups, as well as extensive education, training, networking opportunities related to tech transfer and entrepreneurship. For the purpose of this solicitation, the illustration below provides some descriptors that may be useful in deciding which Track may be the best fit for a proposing organization. It is ultimately up to a proposing organization to determine which Track may present the best alignment for their submission.  Multile tracks: Track 1-Accelerating Technology Transfer (ACT), Track 2-Growing Capacity for Research Translation (GROW), Track 3-Technology Transfer Resource Centers (RESOURCE), Track 4-Education and Training (ET), and Track 5-Coordinating Accelerating Research Translation (CART).",https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/360665,"See link for details per track,",Tracks 1 & 4: 3 years           Tracks 2 & 3: 4 years                  Track 5: 5 years,"2026-01-15 (tracks 2 & 5)                           2026-03-12 (tracks 1, 3, & 4)",

Estimated Post Date: April 1, 2026","National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services","Diabetes has become a major public health challenge due to its high prevalence and chronic nature, with many individuals managing the condition for decades. One major challenge in diabetes is the enormous heterogeneity associated with the disease, which necessitates personalized approaches to its prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. To address this, the research field has generated a large amount of complex data, and has accumulated vast prior knowledge about the disease. These data and prior knowledge contain critical, but mostly hidden, information relevant to solving this challenge. However, major hurdles exist in integrating them and extracting predictive signals, including a lack of data science expertise in the diabetes research field and the absence of diabetes-specific data science and AI expert systems, models, and tools. This initiative proposes to address these issues by establishing a pilot funding program that leverages the emerging opportunities from recent data science and AI advances. It will recruit multidisciplinary teams that include both diabetes and data science experts, to (1) develop AI foundation models for diabetes; (2) validate the models with top research questions in diabetes heterogeneity; (3) disseminate the models and engagement the community for further development, validation and application, and; (4) develop use cases that demonstrate models’ potential in accelerating the tempo of research.

The CDS&E meta-program encourages research that pushes the envelope of science and engineering through computation and data, welcoming proposals in any research area supported by the participating divisions. A proposal may address topics that develop or enable interactions among theory, computing, experiment, and observation to achieve progress on hitherto intractable science and engineering problems. Areas of emphasis for CDS&E vary by program. PIs are advised to consult the ""related programs"" links below before submitting.
The CDS&E meta-program is not intended to replace existing programs that support projects involving computation or the analysis of large or complex data sets using established methods. Rather, proposals submitted to the CDS&E meta-program must have a significant component of computational or data science that goes well beyond what would typically be included in these programs.Any proposal submitted to the CDS&E program that is not responsive to this Program Description may be transferred to or reviewed within the context of an individual program. A proposal requesting consideration within the context of CDS&E should begin the title with the identifying acronym ""CDS&E:"". Supplement requests to existing awards may also be considered. A CDS&E proposal should include substantive science, engineering, or computing research. Algorithm and pilot software development supporting science and engineering may also be appropriate, depending on the program. Proposers who seek to implement proven, existing methods into robust cyberinfrastructure are referred instead to the program on Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI).
A CDS&E proposal should be submitted to one of the ""Related Programs"" or Divisions by the associated submission window, deadline, or target date listed in the table below. In picking the most relevant program, PIs are advised to read program descriptions and solicitations carefully and consult with cognizant Program Officers before proposal preparation.
