Dept. of the Army -- USAMRAA","The FY23 PCRP Data Science Award mechanism supports research where quantitative and analytical approaches, processes, and/or systems are developed and/or used to obtain knowledge and insight from large and/or complex sets of prostate cancer data. If successful, the studies will enable progress toward addressing one or more of the FY23 PCRP Overarching Challenges. It is expected that any tools or datasets generated by this award will be made available for public use. This mechanism is intended to fund research built upon the logic, concepts, and methods of one or more of the following research areas as they pertain to prostate cancer:
• Computational biology
• Bioinformatics
• Artificial intelligence and machine learning
• Epidemiology
• Analysis of –omics data
• Medical imaging
• Digital pathology
• Analysis of other clinically annotated datasets
Applications may combine diverse data types for integrative analysis to increase knowledge about prostate cancer with respect to the FY23 PCRP Overarching Challenges. Applications that propose to develop resources or tools that allow research, clinical care, and patient community access to standardized and harmonized datasets for real-time clinical care applications are of particular interest; however, this award must not be used to support the development of new datasets. Studies utilizing data derived from large patient studies that include long-term health records or repositories with well-annotated and high-quality biospecimens are encouraged.",https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=347770,Direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for the Initiating PI’s and Partnering PI’s applications should not exceed $1M.,3 years,2023-08-24,,

Each of the programs is aimed at building an infrastructure that is used by a particular sub-domain of experimentalists rather than building a single all-encompassing informatics infrastructure now. Building the infrastructure one experimental area at a time will ensure that the infrastructure is immediately useful to components of the research community.

Currently, private-sector investments in knowledge graphs power numerous consumer applications including web search, e-commerce, banking, drug discovery, advertising, etc. Undertaking a similar but inclusive, open, and community-driven effort and making use of publicly available data holds the potential to create a platform that would empower government and non-government users — fueling evidence-based policymaking, continued strong economic growth, game-changing scientific breakthroughs, while addressing complex societal challenges from climate change to social equity.

In some cases, an open-source product that shows potential for wide adoption forms the basis for a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (OSE) that comprises a leadership team; a managing organization with a well-defined governance structure and distributed development model; a cohesive community of external intellectual content developers; and a broad base of users across academia, industry, and government. The overarching vision of POSE is that proactive and intentional formation of managing organizations will ensure a broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products; increased coordination of external intellectual content developer contributions; and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact. Toward this end, the POSE program supports the formation of new OSE managing organizations based on an existing open-source product or class of products, whereby each organization is responsible for the creation and management of processes and infrastructure needed for the efficient and secure development and maintenance of an OSE.
