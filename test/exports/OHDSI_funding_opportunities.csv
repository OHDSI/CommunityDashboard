Solutions are expected to further a new generation of health IT tools and inform the development, implementation, and refinement of health IT standards, methods, and techniques towards enabling widespread adoption of health IT tools to improve healthcare outcomes.
It is critical for the health IT field to be able to innovate and leverage the latest technological advancements and breakthroughs to optimize real-time solutions, especially in areas where health IT has potential to improve the health and healthcare for individuals and populations.
The descriptions provided for the two areas of interest, Area 1 and Area 2, include ways applicants may approach developing a project. The areas of interest have been assigned numbers for ease of reference, not for prioritization. While there are many challenges associated with the use of health IT, ASTP identified these two areas of interest as 2025 priority areas.
In fiscal year 2025, ASTP seeks applications pursuant to the LEAP in Health IT notice of funding opportunity for projects that address one of the following areas of interests:
*Area 1: Demonstrate readiness of FHIR®-based Subscriptions capability as a foundational health IT capability for improved interactivity with third-party applications.
*Area 2: Identify and test innovative technical approaches that would inform future changes to the TEFCA infrastructure to increase adoption of IAS.",https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2025-01/LEAP%20FY2025%20SEN_508.pdf,Not listed,not stated,2025-03-17,

A proposal may address topics that develop or enable interactions among theory, computing, experiment, and observation to achieve progress on hitherto intractable science and engineering problems. Areas of emphasis for CDS&E vary by program. PIs are advised to consult the ""related programs"" links below before submitting.
The CDS&E meta-program is not intended to replace existing programs that support projects involving computation or the analysis of large or complex data sets using established methods. Rather, proposals submitted to the CDS&E meta-program must have a significant component of computational or data science that goes well beyond what would typically be included in these programs.Any proposal submitted to the CDS&E program that is not responsive to this Program Description may be transferred to or reviewed within the context of an individual program. A proposal requesting consideration within the context of CDS&E should begin the title with the identifying acronym ""CDS&E:"". Supplement requests to existing awards may also be considered. A CDS&E proposal should include substantive science, engineering, or computing research. Algorithm and pilot software development supporting science and engineering may also be appropriate, depending on the program. Proposers who seek to implement proven, existing methods into robust cyberinfrastructure are referred instead to the program on Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI).
