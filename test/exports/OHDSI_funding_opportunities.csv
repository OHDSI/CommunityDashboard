In some cases, an open-source product that shows potential for wide adoption forms the basis for a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (OSE) that comprises a leadership team; a managing organization with a well-defined governance structure and distributed development model; a cohesive community of external intellectual content developers; and a broad base of users across academia, industry, and government. The overarching vision of POSE is that proactive and intentional formation of managing organizations will ensure a broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products; increased coordination of external intellectual content developer contributions; and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact. Toward this end, the POSE program supports the formation of new OSE managing organizations based on an existing open-source product or class of products, whereby each organization is responsible for the creation and management of processes and infrastructure needed for the efficient and secure development and maintenance of an OSE.

Currently, private-sector investments in knowledge graphs power numerous consumer applications including web search, e-commerce, banking, drug discovery, advertising, etc. Undertaking a similar but inclusive, open, and community-driven effort and making use of publicly available data holds the potential to create a platform that would empower government and non-government users — fueling evidence-based policymaking, continued strong economic growth, game-changing scientific breakthroughs, while addressing complex societal challenges from climate change to social equity.

The IMPACT-MH initiative has an overall goal of using behavioral measures and computational methods to identify novel clinical signatures that could be used to guide clinical decision-making. The IMPACT-MH DCC funded under this NOFO will: (a) facilitate regular communication and coordination among the funded IMPACT-MH projects; (b) where applicable, support the use of common data elements, standard measures, and uniform data collection procedures; (c) build informatics infrastructure and pipelines necessary to gather and store de-identified, patient-level data; (d) perform computational analyses on datasets collected across all project sites; (e) monitor collected data to identify and address potential biases in data collection, analysis techniques, or subject recruitment and retention practices. The DCC will also maintain a list of the measures and tools used across the funded IMPACT-MH projects, as well as best practices of data collection and analysis, in order to inform future additional studies or future stages of the IMPACT-MH initiative.

The NOFO will support three recipients.  In addition to working collaboratively on the above strategies, each recipient will focus on a specific set of activities (component) relevant to their organizational mission. For Cancer Data Standards Integration (Component 1) recipient will manage the overall coordination of data item development, vetting, and definitions to be included in North American data standards, evaluate the alignment of NAACCR standards with current and emerging national healthcare data standards, and educate NPCR registries on data collection and evaluation to support high-quality data and central cancer registry practice. For Cancer Staging and Care Quality (Component 2), recipient will bridge clinical expertise on TNM cancer staging and cancer quality care measurements with the cancer surveillance system operations, including assessment and incorporation of shared data items into NPCR software. Recipient will also provide education to NPCR and registry staff. For Electronic Cancer Pathology and Laboratory Reporting (Component 3) recipient will develop and maintain interoperable cancer pathology and biomarker reporting laboratories standards and engage in demonstration projects to facilitate report into NPCR registries.  ",https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=342937,"$5,975,000 ",5 years,2023-06-01,,
