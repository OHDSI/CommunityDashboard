A proposal may address topics that develop or enable interactions among theory, computing, experiment, and observation to achieve progress on hitherto intractable science and engineering problems. Areas of emphasis for CDS&E vary by program. PIs are advised to consult the ""related programs"" links below before submitting.
The CDS&E meta-program is not intended to replace existing programs that support projects involving computation or the analysis of large or complex data sets using established methods. Rather, proposals submitted to the CDS&E meta-program must have a significant component of computational or data science that goes well beyond what would typically be included in these programs.Any proposal submitted to the CDS&E program that is not responsive to this Program Description may be transferred to or reviewed within the context of an individual program. A proposal requesting consideration within the context of CDS&E should begin the title with the identifying acronym ""CDS&E:"". Supplement requests to existing awards may also be considered. A CDS&E proposal should include substantive science, engineering, or computing research. Algorithm and pilot software development supporting science and engineering may also be appropriate, depending on the program. Proposers who seek to implement proven, existing methods into robust cyberinfrastructure are referred instead to the program on Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI).
A CDS&E proposal should be submitted to one of the ""Related Programs"" or Divisions by the associated submission window, deadline, or target date listed in the table below. In picking the most relevant program, PIs are advised to read program descriptions and solicitations carefully and consult with cognizant Program Officers before proposal preparation. Proposal submissions outside the receiving program's scientific scope may be transferred to a different program or returned without review.",https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/computational-data-enabled-science-engineering-0,Not listed,not stated,Varible depending on  Division & Program,
