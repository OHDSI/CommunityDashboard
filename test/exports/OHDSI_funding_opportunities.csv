Scalable and Systematic Neurobiology of Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Disorder Risk Genes: Assay and Data Generation Centers (RM1 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services","This Notice of Funding Opportunity announcement (NOFO) supports systematic and scalable approaches to profile the biological function of genes with an excess of damaging mutations in patients with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Current understanding of the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation is limited and one of the main bottlenecks in translating disease-associated genes to biology lies in the lack of scalable experimental platforms that can extend the unbiased nature of gene discovery to the discovery of biological mechanisms. This concept will attempt to fill that gap while also providing a bridge between existing NIMH efforts such as PsychENCODE and Convergent Neuroscience. New technologies and approaches are now making it possible to systematically implement high-throughput assays to determine how disease-linked genetic variation impacts neural function across biological levels of organization. This initiative proposes a series of NOFOs to support the large-scale implementation of high-throughput assays to interrogate the molecular, cellular and physiological function of hundreds of disease-associated genes in parallel. A combination of full-scale and pilot projects will form a consortium for broad characterization of risk genes across an array of endpoints relevant to CNS function using a variety of experimental platforms (e.g., cellular, organismal).

In this phased funding mechanism, applications are required to systematically and comprehensively perform cross-project data harmonization and curation, assessed using Go/No-go data-quality metrics, prior to funding of the second phase of data analyses. Consistent with the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data principles, this funding opportunity expects open-source cataloging of the processes and tools used for harmonization, curation, and analysis, as well as controlled access to the curated datasets.",https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=345706,Application budgets are not limited but must justify and reflect the actual needs of the proposed project.,5 years,2024-03-14,
