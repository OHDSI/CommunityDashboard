METHODS: Patients were identified from four large US claims databases using broad (all T2DM patients) and narrow (intended to exclude patients with type 1 diabetes or secondary diabetes misclassified as T2DM) definitions of T2DM. New users of SGLT2i and seven groups of comparator AHAs were matched (1:1) on exposure propensity scores to adjust for imbalances in baseline covariates. Cox proportional hazards regression models, conditioned on propensity score-matched pairs, were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of DKA for new users of SGLT2i versus other AHAs. When I(2) <40%, a combined HR across the four databases was estimated. RESULTS: Using the broad definition of T2DM, new users of SGLT2i had an increased risk of DKA versus sulfonylureas (HR [95% CI]: 1.53 [1.31-1.79]), DPP-4i (1.28 [1.11-1.47]), GLP-1 receptor agonists (1.34 [1.12-1.60]), metformin (1.31 [1.11-1.54]), and insulinotropic AHAs (1.38 [1.15-1.66]). Using the narrow definition of T2DM, new users of SGLT2i had an increased risk of DKA versus sulfonylureas (1.43 [1.01-2.01]). New users of SGLT2i had a lower risk of DKA versus insulin and a similar risk as thiazolidinediones, regardless of T2DM definition. CONCLUSIONS: Increased risk of DKA was observed for new users of SGLT2i versus several non-SGLT2i AHAs when T2DM was defined broadly. When T2DM was defined narrowly to exclude possible misclassified patients, an increased risk of DKA with SGLT2i was observed compared with sulfonylureas.", "meshT": "['Administrative Claims, Healthcare/statistics & numerical data', 'Aged', 'Blood Glucose', 'Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Insulin/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Metformin/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Sulfonylurea Compounds/adverse effects', 'United States/epidemiology']", "source": "Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2019 Dec;28(12):1620-1628. doi: 10.1002/pds.4887.

However, real-world evidence for effectiveness of recommended regimens remains limited. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of first-line anti-hypertensive treatment combining 2 out of the following classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blocker (A), calcium channel blocker (C), and thiazide-type diuretics (D). METHODS: Treatment-naive hypertensive adults without cardiovascular disease (CVD) who initiated dual anti-hypertensive medications were identified in 5 databases from US and Korea. The patients were matched for each comparison set by large-scale propensity score matching. Primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events as a composite outcome comprised the secondary measure. RESULTS: A total of 987,983 patients met the eligibility criteria. After matching, 222,686, 32,344, and 38,513 patients were allocated to A+C vs. A+D, C+D vs. A+C, and C+D vs. A+D comparison, respectively. There was no significant difference in the mortality during total of 1,806,077 person-years: A+C vs. A+D (hazard ratio [HR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-1.20; p=0.127), C+D vs. A+C (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-1.01; p=0.067), and C+D vs. A+D (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.95-1.47; p=0.104). A+C was associated with a slightly higher risk of heart failure (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.18; p=0.040) and stroke (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17; p=0.040) than A+D.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IBM MarketScan database (2003-2016) was used to analyze visit-level self-harm in 10 120 030 patients with >/=2 MMI codes. Five machine learning (ML) classifiers were tested on a balanced data subset, with XGBoost selected for the full dataset. Classification performance was validated via random data mislabeling and comparison with a clinician-derived \"gold standard.\" The incidence of coded and imputed self-harm was characterized by year, patient age, sex, U.S. state, and MMI diagnosis. RESULTS: Imputation identified 1 592 703 self-harm events vs 83 113 coded events, with areas under the curve >0.99 for the balanced and full datasets, and 83.5% agreement with the gold standard. The overall coded and imputed self-harm incidence were 0.28% and 5.34%, respectively, varied considerably by age and sex, and was highest in individuals with multiple MMI diagnoses. Self-harm undercoding was higher in male than in female individuals and increased with age. Substance abuse, injuries, poisoning, asphyxiation, brain disorders, harmful thoughts, and psychotherapy were the main features used by ML to classify visits. DISCUSSION: Only 1 of 19 self-harm events was coded for individuals with MMI. ML demonstrated excellent performance in recovering self-harm visits. Male individuals and seniors with MMI are particularly vulnerable to self-harm undercoding and may be at risk of not getting appropriate psychiatric care. CONCLUSIONS: ML can effectively recover unrecorded self-harm in claims data and inform psychiatric epidemiological and observational studies.", "meshT": "['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Classification/methods', 'Clinical Coding/*methods', 'Datasets as Topic', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Machine Learning', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*classification/psychology', 'Self-Injurious Behavior/*classification/diagnosis/epidemiology', '*Suicidal Ideation']", "source": "J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2020 Jan 1;27(1):136-146. doi: 10.1093/jamia/ocz173.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Praveen Kumar' 'Anastasiya Nestsiarovich' 'Stuart J Nelson' 'Berit Kerner' 'Douglas J Perkins' 'Christophe G Lambert'", "firstAuthor": "'Praveen Kumar", "pubYear": 2019, "titleAuthorStr": "Imputation and characterization of uncoded self-harm in major mental illness using machine learning.

Randomised trials have not further refined this choice. METHODS: We developed a comprehensive framework for real-world evidence that enables comparative effectiveness and safety evaluation across many drugs and outcomes from observational data encompassing millions of patients, while minimising inherent bias. Using this framework, we did a systematic, large-scale study under a new-user cohort design to estimate the relative risks of three primary (acute myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for heart failure, and stroke) and six secondary effectiveness and 46 safety outcomes comparing all first-line classes across a global network of six administrative claims and three electronic health record databases. The framework addressed residual confounding, publication bias, and p-hacking using large-scale propensity adjustment, a large set of control outcomes, and full disclosure of hypotheses tested. FINDINGS: Using 4.9 million patients, we generated 22 000 calibrated, propensity-score-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) comparing all classes and outcomes across databases. Most estimates revealed no effectiveness differences between classes; however, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics showed better primary effectiveness than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: acute myocardial infarction (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.95), hospitalisation for heart failure (0.83, 0.74-0.95), and stroke (0.83, 0.74-0.95) risk while on initial treatment. Safety profiles also favoured thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics over angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers were significantly inferior to the other four classes. INTERPRETATION: This comprehensive framework introduces a new way of doing observational health-care science at scale. The approach supports equivalence between drug classes for initiating monotherapy for hypertension-in keeping with current guidelines, with the exception of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics superiority to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the inferiority of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

The objectives of EMIF included providing a unified platform to support a wide range of studies within two verification programmes-Alzheimer's disease (EMIF-AD), and metabolic consequences of obesity (EMIF-MET). METHODS: The EMIF platform was built around two main data-types: electronic health record data and research cohort data, and the platform architecture composed of a set of tools designed to enable data discovery and characterisation. This included the EMIF catalogue, which allowed users to find relevant data sources, including the data-types collected. Data harmonisation via a common data model were central to the project especially for population data sources. EMIF also developed an ethical code of practice to ensure data protection, patient confidentiality and compliance with the European Data Protection Directive, and GDPR. RESULTS: Currently 18 population-based disease agnostic and 60 cohort-based Alzheimer's data partners from across 14 countries are contained within the catalogue, and this will continue to expand. The work conducted in EMIF-AD and EMIF-MET includes standardizing cohorts, summarising baseline characteristics of patients, developing diagnostic algorithms, epidemiological studies, identifying and validating novel biomarkers and selecting potential patient samples for pharmacological intervention. CONCLUSIONS: EMIF was designed to provide a sustainable model as demonstrated by the sustainability plans for EMIF-AD. Although network-wide studies using EMIF were not conducted during this project to evaluate its sustainability, learning from EMIF will be used in the follow-on IMI-2 project, European Health Data and Evidence Network (EHDEN). Furthermore, EMIF has facilitated collaborations between partners and continues to promote a wider adoption of principles, technology and architecture through some of its continued work.", "meshT": "nan", "source": "Learn Health Syst. 2019 Dec 25;4(2):e10214. doi: 10.1002/lrh2.10214. eCollection 2020 Apr.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Simon Lovestone'", "firstAuthor": "'Simon Lovestone'", "pubYear": 2020, "titleAuthorStr": "The European medical information framework: A novel ecosystem for sharing healthcare data across Europe.

A small number of AP events were reported in clinical trials of the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor canagliflozin, though no imbalances were observed between treatment groups. This observational study evaluated risk of AP among new users of canagliflozin compared with new users of six classes of other antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs).Methods: Three US claims databases were analyzed based on a prespecified protocol approved by the European Medicines Agency. Propensity score adjustment controlled for imbalances in baseline covariates. Cox regression models estimated the hazard ratio of AP with canagliflozin compared with other AHAs using on-treatment (primary) and intent-to-treat approaches. Sensitivity analyses assessed robustness of findings.Results: Across the three databases, there were between 12,023-80,986 new users of canagliflozin; the unadjusted incidence rates of AP (per 1000 person-years) were between 1.5-2.2 for canagliflozin and 1.1-6.6 for other AHAs. The risk of AP was generally similar for new users of canagliflozin compared with new users of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, insulin, and other AHAs, with no consistent between-treatment differences observed across databases. Intent-to-treat and sensitivity analysis findings were qualitatively consistent with on-treatment findings.Conclusions: In this large observational study, incidence rates of AP in patients with T2DM treated with canagliflozin or other AHAs were generally similar, with no evidence suggesting that canagliflozin is associated with increased risk of AP compared with other AHAs.", "meshT": "['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Canagliflozin/*adverse effects', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreatitis/*chemically induced', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']", "source": "Curr Med Res Opin. 2020 Jul;36(7):1117-1124. doi: 10.1080/03007995.2020.1761312.

A previous study relying on negative controls suggested that using large-scale propensity score (LSPS) matching may mitigate bias better than models using limited lists of covariates. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess whether using LSPS matching would enable the evaluation of paracetamol, compared to ibuprofen, and increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, or acute renal failure. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In a new-user cohort study, we used two propensity score model strategies for confounder controls. One replicated the approach of controlling for a hand-picked list. The second used LSPSs based on all available covariates for matching. Positive and negative controls assessed residual confounding and calibrated confidence intervals. The data source was the Clinical Practices Research Datalink (CPRD). RESULTS: A substantial proportion of negative controls were statistically significant after propensity score matching on the publication covariates, indicating considerable systematic error. LSPS adjustment was less biased, but residual error remained. The calibrated estimates resulted in very wide confidence intervals, indicating large uncertainty in effect estimates once residual error was incorporated. CONCLUSIONS: For paracetamol versus ibuprofen, when using LSPS methods in the CPRD, it is only possible to distinguish true effects if those effects are large (hazard ratio > 2). Due to their smaller hazard ratios, the outcomes under study cannot be differentiated from null effects (represented by negative controls) even if there were a true effect. Based on these data, we conclude that we are unable to determine whether paracetamol is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, GI bleeding, and acute renal failure compared to ibuprofen, due to residual confounding.", "meshT": "['Acetaminophen/*adverse effects', 'Acute Kidney Injury/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*adverse effects', 'Bias', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Ibuprofen/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction/chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Propensity Score', 'Risk Factors', 'Stroke/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']", "source": "Drug Saf. 2020 Sep;43(9):927-942. doi: 10.1007/s40264-020-00950-3.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Rachel B Weinstein' 'Patrick B Ryan' 'Jesse A Berlin' 'Martijn J Schuemie' 'Joel Swerdel' 'Daniel Fife'", "firstAuthor": "'Rachel B Weinstein", "pubYear": 2020, "titleAuthorStr": "Channeling Bias in the Analysis of Risk of Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, Gastrointestinal Bleeding, and Acute Renal Failure with the Use of Paracetamol Compared with Ibuprofen.

Approaches to enforcing strong ignorability in causal analyses of observational data include weighting and matching methods.

The choice of P is important and can impact the interpretation of the effect estimate and the variance of effect estimates. In this work, instead of specifying P, we learn a distribution that simultaneously maximizes coverage and minimizes variance of ATE estimates. In order to learn this distribution, this research proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based model called the Counterfactual chi-GAN (cGAN), which also learns feature-balancing weights and supports unbiased causal estimation in the absence of unobserved confounding. Our model minimizes the Pearson chi(2)-divergence, which we show simultaneously maximizes coverage and minimizes the variance of importance sampling estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first such application of the Pearson chi(2)-divergence.

Through propensity score matching, we achieve balance on all baseline patient characteristics for 75% of estimates, observe 95.7% coverage in our effect-estimate 95% confidence intervals, find high between-database consistency, and achieve transitivity in 84.8% of triplet hypotheses. Compared with meta-analyses of RCTs, our results are consistent with 28 of 30 comparisons while providing narrower confidence intervals. CONCLUSION: We find that these LEGEND results show high internal validity and are congruent with meta-analyses of RCTs. For these reasons we believe that evidence generated by LEGEND is of high quality and can inform medical decision-making where evidence is currently lacking. Subsequent publications will explore the clinical interpretations of this evidence.", "meshT": "['Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Confidence Intervals', '*Databases, Factual', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*drug therapy', '*Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Observation', 'Propensity Score', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']", "source": "J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2020 Aug 1;27(8):1268-1277. doi: 10.1093/jamia/ocaa124.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Martijn J Schuemie' 'Patrick B Ryan' 'Nicole Pratt' 'RuiJun Chen' 'Seng Chan You' 'Harlan M Krumholz' 'David Madigan' 'George Hripcsak' 'Marc A Suchard'", "firstAuthor": "'Martijn J Schuemie", "pubYear": 2020, "titleAuthorStr": "Large-scale evidence generation and evaluation across a network of databases (LEGEND): assessing validity using hypertension as a case study.

However, there is limited literature providing comparisons of APMs use among countries. To examine trends in antipsychotic prescribing in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States, we conducted a cross-national study from 2002 to 2014 b y using the distributed network approach with common data model. We included all patients who had at least a record of antipsychotic prescription in this study, and defined patients without previous exposure of antipsychotics for 6 months before the index date as new users for incidence estimation. We calculated the incidence, prevalence, and prescription rate of each medication by calendar year. Among older patients, sulpiride was the most incident [incidence rate (IR) 11.0-23.3) and prevalent [prevalence rate (PR) 11.9-14.3) APM in Taiwan, and most prevalent (PR 2.5-3.9) in Japan. Quetiapine and haloperidol were most common in the United States (IR 8.1-9.5; PR 18.0-18.4) and Hong Kong (PR 8.8-13.7; PR 10.6-12.7), respectively. The trend of quetiapine use was increasing in Taiwan, Hong Kong and the United States. As compared to older patients, the younger patients had more propensity to be prescribed second-generation APM for treatment in four countries. Trends in antipsychotic prescribing varied among countries. Quetiapine use was most prevalent in the United States and increasing in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The increasing use of quetiapine in the elderly patients might be due to its safety profile compared to other APMs.", "meshT": "['Aged', '*Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Hong Kong/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan', 'Prescriptions', 'Prevalence', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']", "source": "J Psychiatr Res. 2020 Dec;131:77-84. doi: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.08.025.

One key decision is how to include patients who are lost to follow-up. In this paper we perform a large-scale empirical evaluation investigating the impact of this decision. In addition, we aim to provide guidelines for how to deal with loss to follow-up. METHODS: We generate a partially synthetic dataset with complete follow-up and simulate loss to follow-up based either on random selection or on selection based on comorbidity. In addition to our synthetic data study we investigate 21 real-world data prediction problems. We compare four simple strategies for developing models when using a cohort design that encounters loss to follow-up. Three strategies employ a binary classifier with data that: (1) include all patients (including those lost to follow-up), (2) exclude all patients lost to follow-up or (3) only exclude patients lost to follow-up who do not have the outcome before being lost to follow-up. The fourth strategy uses a survival model with data that include all patients. We empirically evaluate the discrimination and calibration performance. RESULTS: The partially synthetic data study results show that excluding patients who are lost to follow-up can introduce bias when loss to follow-up is common and does not occur at random. However, when loss to follow-up was completely at random, the choice of addressing it had negligible impact on model discrimination performance. Our empirical real-world data results showed that the four design choices investigated to deal with loss to follow-up resulted in comparable performance when the time-at-risk was 1-year but demonstrated differential bias when we looked into 3-year time-at-risk. Removing patients who are lost to follow-up before experiencing the outcome but keeping patients who are lost to follow-up after the outcome can bias a model and should be avoided. CONCLUSION: Based on this study we therefore recommend (1) developing models using data that includes patients that are lost to follow-up and (2) evaluate the discrimination and calibration of models twice: on a test set including patients lost to follow-up and a test set excluding patients lost to follow-up.", "meshT": "['Bias', 'Calibration', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', '*Lost to Follow-Up', 'Prognosis']", "source": "BMC Med Inform Decis Mak. 2021 Feb 6;21(1):43. doi: 10.1186/s12911-021-01408-x.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Jenna M Reps' 'Peter Rijnbeek' 'Alana Cuthbert' 'Patrick B Ryan' 'Nicole Pratt' 'Martijn Schuemie'", "firstAuthor": "'Jenna M Reps", "pubYear": 2021, "titleAuthorStr": "An empirical analysis of dealing with patients who are lost to follow-up when developing prognostic models using a cohort design.

in-hospital treatments, and health outcomes among children and adolescents diagnosed or hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to compare them in secondary analyses with patients diagnosed with previous seasonal influenza in 2017-2018. METHODS: International network cohort using real-world data from European primary care records (France, Germany, and Spain), South Korean claims and US claims, and hospital databases. We included children and adolescents diagnosed and/or hospitalized with COVID-19 at age <18 between January and June 2020. We described baseline demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, 30-day in-hospital treatments, and outcomes including hospitalization, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and death. RESULTS: A total of 242 158 children and adolescents diagnosed and 9769 hospitalized with COVID-19 and 2 084 180 diagnosed with influenza were studied. Comorbidities including neurodevelopmental disorders, heart disease, and cancer were more common among those hospitalized with versus diagnosed with COVID-19. Dyspnea, bronchiolitis, anosmia, and gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in COVID-19 than influenza. In-hospital prevalent treatments for COVID-19 included repurposed medications (<10%) and adjunctive therapies: systemic corticosteroids (6.8%-7.6%), famotidine (9.0%-28.1%), and antithrombotics such as aspirin (2.0%-21.4%), heparin (2.2%-18.1%), and enoxaparin (2.8%-14.8%). Hospitalization was observed in 0.3% to 1.3% of the cohort diagnosed with COVID-19, with undetectable (n < 5 per database) 30-day fatality. Thirty-day outcomes including pneumonia and hypoxemia were more frequent in COVID-19 than influenza. CONCLUSIONS: Despite negligible fatality, complications including hospitalization, hypoxemia, and pneumonia were more frequent in children and adolescents with COVID-19 than with influenza. Dyspnea, anosmia, and gastrointestinal symptoms could help differentiate diagnoses. A wide range of medications was used for the inpatient management of pediatric COVID-19.", "meshT": "['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', '*COVID-19/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Databases, Factual', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Influenza, Human/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Symptom Assessment', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology']", "source": "Pediatrics. 2021 Sep;148(3). pii: peds.2020-042929. doi: 10.1542/peds.2020-042929.

The NCATS' National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) is a centralized data resource representing the largest multicenter cohort of COVID-19 cases and controls nationwide. We aimed to construct and characterize the cancer cohort within N3C and identify risk factors for all-cause mortality from COVID-19. METHODS: We used 4,382,085 patients from 50 US medical centers to construct a cohort of patients with cancer. We restricted analyses to adults >/= 18 years old with a COVID-19-positive or COVID-19-negative diagnosis between January 1, 2020, and March 25, 2021. We followed N3C selection of an index encounter per patient for analyses. All analyses were performed in the N3C Data Enclave Palantir platform. RESULTS: A total of 398,579 adult patients with cancer were identified from the N3C cohort; 63,413 (15.9%) were COVID-19-positive. Most common represented cancers were skin (13.8%), breast (13.7%), prostate (10.6%), hematologic (10.5%), and GI cancers (10%). COVID-19 positivity was significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.24). Among COVID-19-positive patients, age >/= 65 years, male gender, Southern or Western US residence, an adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index score >/= 4, hematologic malignancy, multitumor sites, and recent cytotoxic therapy were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Patients who received recent immunotherapies or targeted therapies did not have higher risk of overall mortality. CONCLUSION: Using N3C, we assembled the largest nationally representative cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 to date. We identified demographic and clinical factors associated with increased all-cause mortality in patients with cancer. Full characterization of the cohort will provide further insights into the effects of COVID-19 on cancer outcomes and the ability to continue specific cancer treatments.", "meshT": "['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'COVID-19/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'United States', 'Young Adult']", "source": "J Clin Oncol. 2021 Jul 10;39(20):2232-2246. doi: 10.1200/JCO.21.01074.

At the same time, however, detection is challenging due to dynamic biological processes during growth and maturation, called ontogeny, that alter pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. As a result, methodologies in pediatric drug safety have been limited to event surveillance and have not focused on investigating adverse event mechanisms. There is an opportunity to identify drug event patterns within observational databases for evaluating ontogenic-mediated adverse event mechanisms. The first step of which is to establish statistical models that can identify temporal trends of adverse effects across childhood. RESULTS: Using simulation, we evaluated a population stratification method (the proportional reporting ratio or PRR) and a population modeling method (the generalized additive model or GAM) to identify and quantify ADE risk at varying reporting rates and dynamics. We found that GAMs showed improved performance over the PRR in detecting dynamic drug event reporting across child development stages.

One potential source of bias is the index date selection procedure for the unvaccinated cohort or unvaccinated comparison time (\"anchoring\"). OBJECTIVE: Here, we evaluated the different index date selection procedures for 2 vaccinations: COVID-19 and influenza. METHODS: For each vaccine, we extracted patient baseline characteristics on the index date and up to 450 days prior and then compared them to the characteristics of the unvaccinated patients indexed on (1) an arbitrary date or (2) a date of a visit. Additionally, we compared vaccinated patients indexed on the date of vaccination and the same patients indexed on a prior date or visit. RESULTS: COVID-19 vaccination and influenza vaccination differ drastically from each other in terms of the populations vaccinated and their status on the day of vaccination. When compared to indexing on a visit in the unvaccinated population, influenza vaccination had markedly higher covariate proportions, and COVID-19 vaccination had lower proportions of most covariates on the index date. In contrast, COVID-19 vaccination had similar covariate proportions when compared to an arbitrary date. These effects attenuated, but were still present, with a longer lookback period. The effect of day 0 was present even when the patients served as their own controls. CONCLUSIONS: Patient baseline characteristics are sensitive to the choice of the index date. In vaccine safety studies, unexposed index event should represent vaccination settings. Study designs previously used to assess influenza vaccination must be reassessed for COVID-19 to account for a potentially healthier population and lack of medical activity on the day of vaccination.", "meshT": "['*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', '*Influenza Vaccines/adverse effects', '*Influenza, Human/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care']", "source": "JMIR Public Health Surveill. 2022 Jun 17;8(6):e33099. doi: 10.2196/33099.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Anna Ostropolets' 'Patrick B Ryan' 'Martijn J Schuemie' 'George Hripcsak'", "firstAuthor": "'Anna Ostropolets", "pubYear": 2022, "titleAuthorStr": "Characterizing Anchoring Bias in Vaccine Comparator Selection Due to Health Care Utilization With COVID-19 and Influenza: Observational Cohort Study.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether chronographs, typically used for rapid signal detection in observational longitudinal databases, could be used to visualize RM effectiveness. We evaluated the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) 2012 proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) class-wide label change that warned of increased risk of bone fracture, advocated to limit duration of use, and recommended to treat those at risk for osteoporosis according to clinical guidelines. METHODS: The cohort consisted of adults aged 18 years and above prescribed one of the five PPIs available in the UK The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database through September 2015. Four chronographs were compared using drug episodes that started before (PRE) and after (POST) the 20 April 2012 MHRA warning; fracture and osteoporosis were evaluated separately. Chronographs show a measure of observed/expected events, the Information Component (IC) and 95% credibility interval (CI), calculated at monthly time intervals relative to the start date of a prescription, and summed to estimate IC over a 3-year period; IC > 0 indicates observed > expected events. We hypothesized that chronographs may assess RM effectiveness if stratified by PRE/POST an RM intervention such as a label change. RESULTS: There were 1,588,973 and 664,601 PPI users in the PRE and POST periods, respectively. We observed a 4.6% reduction in the proportion of long-term PPI episodes and a 4.1% reduction in the overall proportion of the THIN population using PPIs. Compared with the PRE chronographs, when both visually comparing and when examining the summed ICs for fracture in the POST period, a significant reduction was observed overall (IC = 0.024 [95% CI 0.015 to 0.33] PRE vs - 0.141 [95% CI - 0.162 to - 0.120] POST), suggesting less observed events than expected, and prior to PPI start, suggestive of strong channeling (IC = - 0.027 [95% CI - 0.037 to - 0.017] PRE vs - 0.291 [95% CI - 0.308 to - 0.274] POST). Results were qualitatively similar for osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot demonstrated a novel application of a visual, rapid analysis technique to assess RM effectiveness, and supported a hypothesis that prescribers altered some behaviors after the MHRA label change, such as channeling patients at risk of fracture or osteoporosis away from PPI use and potentially reducing fracture outcomes. Limitations include lack of confounding control and outcomes defined only by diagnosis code. Results demonstrate the potential to use large healthcare databases with chronographs to rapidly assess RM effectiveness, similar to signal detection in pharmacovigilance, and may help design more comprehensive RM evaluation studies.", "meshT": "['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Data Display', '*Drug Labeling', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Product Surveillance, Postmarketing', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Management', 'United Kingdom', 'Young Adult']", "source": "Drug Saf. 2019 Nov;42(11):1365-1376. doi: 10.1007/s40264-019-00853-y.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Rachel E Sobel' 'William Blackwell' 'David M Fram' 'Andrew Bate'", "firstAuthor": "'Rachel E Sobel", "pubYear": 2019, "titleAuthorStr": "A Novel Approach to Visualize Risk Minimization Effectiveness: Peeping at the 2012 UK Proton Pump Inhibitor Label Change Using a Rapid Cycle Analysis Tool.

Routine quantitative signal detection primarily focuses on screening of spontaneous reports. In striving to enhance quantitative signal detection capability further, other data streams are being considered for their potential contribution as sources of emerging signals, one of which is longitudinal observational databases, including electronic medical record (EMR) and transactional insurance claims databases. Quantitative signal detection on such databases is a nascent field-with published methods being primarily based either on individual metrics, which may not effectively represent the complexity of the longitudinal records and their necessary variation for analysis for drug-outcome pairs, or on visualization discovery approaches leveraging multiple aspects of the records, which are not particularly tractable to high-throughput hypothesis-free signal detection. One extensively tested example of the latter is chronographs. METHODS: We apply a disturbance detection algorithm to chronographs using UK EMR The Health Improvement Network (THIN) data. The algorithm utilizes autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)-based time series methodology designed to find disturbances that occur outside the normal pattern trends of the ARIMA model for the chronograph. Chronographs currently highlight drug-event pairs as potentially worthy of further clinical assessment, via filter-based increases in disproportionality scores from before to after the index drug exposure, tested across a range of case and control windows. RESULTS: We replicate the findings on six exemplar chronographs from a previous publication, and show how disturbances can be effectively detected across this set of pairs. Further, 692 disturbances were detected in analysis of all 384 individual READ code outcomes ever recorded 50 or more times for patients prescribed sibutramine. The disturbances are algorithmically further broken into subsets of clinical interest. CONCLUSION: Overall, the disturbance algorithm approach shows promising capacity for detecting outliers, and shows tractability of the algorithmic approach for large-scale screening. The method offers an array of pattern types for detection and clinical review.", "meshT": "['Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/statistics & numerical data', 'Databases, Factual', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Records/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Observational Studies as Topic', '*Pharmacovigilance']", "source": "Drug Saf. 2018 Jun;41(6):565-577. doi: 10.1007/s40264-018-0640-8.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Ed Whalen' 'Manfred Hauben' 'Andrew Bate'", "firstAuthor": "'Ed Whalen", "pubYear": 2018, "titleAuthorStr": "Time Series Disturbance Detection for Hypothesis-Free Signal Detection in Longitudinal Observational Databases.

Relative performance in identifying known drug-outcome associations was examined using a set of 50 well-studied drug-outcome pairs. The study finds that neither method correctly identified all pairs but that LLMP often provides better ability and shorter time for identifying the known drug-outcome associations with superior computational performance when compared with CSSP, albeit with more false positives. With the features of flexible confounding control and ease of implementation, LLMP may be a good alternative or complement to CSSP.", "meshT": "['Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/*statistics & numerical data', 'Databases, Factual/*statistics & numerical data', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Insurance Claim Review/*statistics & numerical data', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Observational Studies as Topic/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Product Surveillance, Postmarketing/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies']", "source": "J Biopharm Stat. 2018;28(4):668-681. doi: 10.1080/10543406.2017.1372776.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relative performance of different statistical methods for detecting drug-adverse event associations in electronic health care record data representing potential ADRs. RESEARCH DESIGN: Data from 7 databases across 3 countries in Europe comprising over 20 million subjects were used to compute the relative risk estimates for drug-event pairs using 10 different methods, including those developed for spontaneous reporting systems, cohort methods such as the longitudinal gamma poisson shrinker, and case-based methods such as case-control. The newly developed method \"longitudinal evaluation of observational profiles of adverse events related to drugs\" (LEOPARD) was used to remove associations likely caused by protopathic bias. Data from the different databases were combined by pooling of data, and by meta-analysis for random effects. A reference standard of known ADRs and negative controls was created to evaluate the performance of the method. MEASURES: The area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic curve was calculated for each method, both with and without LEOPARD filtering. RESULTS: The highest area under the curve (0.83) was achieved by the combination of either longitudinal gamma poisson shrinker or case-control with LEOPARD filtering, but the performance between methods differed little. LEOPARD increased the overall performance, but flagged several known ADRs as caused by protopathic bias.

Data from electronic health records and other clinical sources are useful for such studies, but require stringent quality assessment. Data quality assessment is particularly important in multisite studies to distinguish true variations in care from data quality problems. METHODS: We propose a \"fit-for-use\" conceptual model for data quality assessment and a process model for planning and conducting single-site and multisite data quality assessments. These approaches are illustrated using examples from prior multisite studies. APPROACH: Critical components of multisite data quality assessment include: thoughtful prioritization of variables and data quality dimensions for assessment; development and use of standardized approaches to data quality assessment that can improve data utility over time; iterative cycles of assessment within and between sites; targeting assessment toward data domains known to be vulnerable to quality problems; and detailed documentation of the rationale and outcomes of data quality assessments to inform data users. The assessment process requires constant communication between site-level data providers, data coordinating centers, and principal investigators. DISCUSSION: A conceptually based and systematically executed approach to data quality assessment is essential to achieve the potential of the electronic revolution in health care. High-quality data allow \"learning health care organizations\" to analyze and act on their own information, to compare their outcomes to peers, and to address critical scientific questions from the population perspective.", "meshT": "['Comparative Effectiveness Research/*organization & administration/standards', 'Cooperative Behavior', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', 'Medical Informatics', '*Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care/*standards', 'United States']", "source": "Med Care. 2012 Jul;50 Suppl:S21-9. doi: 10.1097/MLR.0b013e318257dd67.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Michael G Kahn' 'Marsha A Raebel' 'Jason M Glanz' 'Karen Riedlinger' 'John F Steiner'", "firstAuthor": "'Michael G Kahn", "pubYear": 2012, "titleAuthorStr": "A pragmatic framework for single-site and multisite data quality assessment in electronic health record-based clinical research.

Such surveillance increasingly utilizes large-scale longitudinal observational databases (LODs), containing time-stamped patient-level medical information including periods of drug exposure and dates of diagnoses for millions of patients. Statistical methods for LODs must confront computational challenges related to the scale of the data, and must also address confounding and other biases that can undermine efforts to estimate effect sizes. Methods that compare on-drug with off-drug periods within patient offer specific advantages over between patient analysis on both counts. To accomplish these aims, we extend the self-controlled case series (SCCS) for LODs. SCCS implicitly controls for fixed multiplicative baseline covariates since each individual acts as their own control. In addition, only exposed cases are required for the analysis, which is computationally advantageous. The standard SCCS approach is usually used to assess single drugs and therefore estimates marginal associations between individual drugs and particular AEs. Such analyses ignore confounding drugs and interactions and have the potential to give misleading results. In order to avoid these difficulties, we propose a regularized multiple SCCS approach that incorporates potentially thousands or more of time-varying confounders such as other drugs. The approach successfully handles the high dimensionality and can provide a sparse solution via an L(1) regularizer.

Of the fluoroquinolone-exposed cases, 83 % were exposed to ciprofloxacin. We sought to replicate this finding, and assess whether it applied to all fluoroquinolones. METHODS: In two large US healthcare databases, we performed three case-control analyses: one replicating the recent study; one addressing additional potential confounders; and one that increased sample size by dropping the Canadian study's requirement for a prior ophthalmologist visit. We also performed a self-controlled case-series (SCCS) analysis in which each subject served as his or her own comparator. RESULTS: In the replication case-control analyses, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for any exposure to fluoroquinolones or ciprofloxacin were approximately 1.2 in both databases, and were statistically significant, and the ORs for current exposure were modestly above 1 in one database, modestly below 1 in the other, and not statistically significant. In the other case-control analyses, the ORs were close to 1. In a post hoc age-stratified case-control analysis, we observed an association of RD with fluoroquinolone exposure among older subjects in one of the two databases. All estimates from the SCCS analyses were below 1.2 and none was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The present study does not confirm the recent Canadian study's finding of a strong relationship between RD and current exposure to fluoroquinolones.

CASE DESCRIPTION: This paper outlines a sustainable business model of ongoing infrastructure support for clinical data research activities. The DARTNet Institute is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization that serves as a support entity for multiple practice-based research networks. Several clinical data research networks working closely with a professional society began collaborating to support shared goals in 2008. This loose affiliation called itself the \"DARTNet Collaborative.\" In 2011, the DARTNet Institute incorporated as an independent, not-for-profit entity. The business structure allows DARTNet to advocate for all partners without operating its own practice-based research network, serve as a legal voice for activities that overlap multiple partners, share personnel resources through service contracts between partners, and purchase low-cost (nonprofit rate) software. MAJOR THEMES: DARTNet's business model relies upon four diverse sources of revenue: (1) DARTNet licenses and provides access to a propriety software system that extracts, transforms, and loads data from all major electronic health records (EHRs) utilized in the United States, and which also provides clinical decision support for research studies; (2) DARTNet operates a recognized, national professional-society-quality improvement registry that enables organizations to fulfill Meaningful Use 2 criteria; (3) DARTNet provides access to data for research activities that are funded by direct research dollars, provided at prices that generate excess revenue; and (4) DARTNet provides access to large primary care datasets for observational studies and pregrant analyses such as for sample size development. The ability of the system to support pragmatic trials will be described. CONCLUSION: The DARTNet model facilitates the use of direct grant dollars to generate revenue to support the overall enterprise through a purchased services arrangement. Other services provided through subcontracting provide facilities and administration fees as well as direct dollars to support the system. The flexibility of the business model overcomes the complicated financial arrangements and governance requirements of many professional associations and academic medical centers.", "meshT": "nan", "source": "EGEMS (Wash DC). 2014 Sep 2;2(2):1063. doi: 10.13063/2327-9214.1063. eCollection 2014.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Wilson D Pace' 'Chester H Fox' 'Turner White' 'Deborah Graham' 'Lisa M Schilling' 'David R West'", "firstAuthor": "'Wilson D Pace", "pubYear": 2015, "titleAuthorStr": "The DARTNet Institute: Seeking a Sustainable Support Mechanism for Electronic Data Enabled Research Networks.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether there were any temporal patterns in hospitalizations for ALI that would correspond to assumed acetaminophen use in cold/flu season. METHODS: In the period 2002-2010, monthly hospitalization rates for ALI using a variety of case definitions were calculated. Data sources included Truven MarketScan((R)) Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE) and Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits (MDCR) databases. We performed a statistical test for seasonality of diagnoses using the periodic generalized linear model. To validate that the test can distinguish seasonal from nonseasonal patterns, we included two positive controls (ie, diagnoses of the common cold [acute nasopharyngitis] and influenza), believed to change with seasons, and two negative controls (female breast cancer and diabetes), believed to be insensitive to season. RESULTS: A seasonal pattern was observed in monthly rates for common cold and influenza diagnoses, but this pattern was not observed for monthly rates of ALI, with or without comorbidities (cirrhosis or hepatitis), breast cancer, or diabetes. The statistical test for seasonality was significant for positive controls (P<0.001 for each diagnosis in both databases) and nonsignificant for ALI and negative controls. CONCLUSION: No seasonal pattern was observed in the diagnosis of ALI.

Machine learning approaches to electronic phenotyping are limited by the paucity of labeled training datasets. We demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing semi-automatically labeled training sets to create phenotype models via machine learning, using a comprehensive representation of the patient medical record. METHODS: We use a list of keywords specific to the phenotype of interest to generate noisy labeled training data. We train L1 penalized logistic regression models for a chronic and an acute disease and evaluate the performance of the models against a gold standard. RESULTS: Our models for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction achieve precision and accuracy of 0.90, 0.89, and 0.86, 0.89, respectively. Local implementations of the previously validated rule-based definitions for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction achieve precision and accuracy of 0.96, 0.92 and 0.84, 0.87, respectively.We have demonstrated feasibility of learning phenotype models using imperfectly labeled data for a chronic and acute phenotype. Further research in feature engineering and in specification of the keyword list can improve the performance of the models and the scalability of the approach.

Such an approach can accelerate research with large observational healthcare datasets and may also be used to create local phenotype models.", "meshT": "['Algorithms', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', '*Machine Learning', 'Medical Informatics Computing', '*Models, Statistical', 'Myocardial Infarction', '*Phenotype', 'Vocabulary, Controlled']", "source": "J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2016 Nov;23(6):1166-1173. doi: 10.1093/jamia/ocw028.

Our objective was to compare hypothyroidism risk for lithium versus the anticonvulsants and second-generation antipsychotics commonly prescribed for BD. METHODS: Administrative claims data on 24,574 patients with BD were analyzed with competing risk survival analysis. Inclusion criteria were (i) one year of no prior hypothyroid diagnosis nor BD drug treatment, (ii) followed by at least one thyroid test during BD monotherapy on lithium carbonate, mood-stabilizing anticonvulsants (lamotrigine, valproate, oxcarbazepine, or carbamazepine) or antipsychotics (aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine). The outcome was cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism per drug, in the presence of the competing risk of ending monotherapy, adjusted for age, sex, physician visits, and thyroid tests. RESULTS: Adjusting for covariates, the four-year cumulative risk of hypothyroidism for lithium (8.8%) was 1.39-fold that of the lowest risk therapy, oxcarbazepine (6.3%). Lithium was non-statistically significantly different from quetiapine. While lithium conferred a higher risk when compared to all other treatments combined as a group, hypothyroidism risk error bars overlapped for all drugs. Treatment (p = 3.86e-3), age (p = 6.91e-10), sex (p = 3.93e-7), and thyroid testing (p = 2.79e-87) affected risk. Patients taking lithium were tested for hypothyroidism 2.26-3.05 times more frequently than those on other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid abnormalities occur frequently in patients with BD regardless of treatment. Therefore, patients should be regularly tested for clinical or subclinical thyroid abnormalities on all therapies and treated as indicated to prevent adverse effects of hormone imbalances on mood.", "meshT": "['Adult', 'Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antimanic Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/*chemically induced', 'Lithium Compounds/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis']", "source": "Bipolar Disord. 2016 May;18(3):247-60. doi: 10.1111/bdi.12391.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Christophe G Lambert' 'Aurelien J Mazurie' 'Nicolas R Lauve' 'Nathaniel G Hurwitz' 'S Stanley Young' 'Robert L Obenchain' 'Nicolas W Hengartner' 'Douglas J Perkins' 'Mauricio Tohen' 'Berit Kerner'", "firstAuthor": "'Christophe G Lambert", "pubYear": 2016, "titleAuthorStr": "Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort.

Emerging national patient claims and electronic health record databases have inspired post-approval early detection methods like the Bayesian self-controlled case series (BSCCS) regression model. Existing BSCCS models do not account for multiple outcomes, where pathology may be shared across different ADEs. We integrate a pathology hierarchy into the BSCCS model by developing a novel informative hierarchical prior linking outcome-specific effects. Considering shared pathology drastically increases the dimensionality of the already massive models in this field. We develop an efficient method for coping with the dimensionality expansion by reducing the hierarchical model to a form amenable to existing tools. Through a synthetic study we demonstrate decreased bias in risk estimates for drugs when using conditions with different true risk and unequal prevalence. We also examine observational data from the MarketScan Lab Results dataset, exposing the bias that results from aggregating outcomes, as previously employed to estimate risk trends of warfarin and dabigatran for intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Signal detection is presently unimodal, relying on a single information source. Multimodal signal detection is based on jointly analyzing multiple information sources. Building on, and expanding the work done in prior studies, the aim of the article is to further research on multimodal signal detection, explore its potential benefits, and propose methods for its construction and evaluation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four data sources are investigated; FDA's adverse event reporting system, insurance claims, the MEDLINE citation database, and the logs of major Web search engines. Published methods are used to generate and combine signals from each data source. Two distinct reference benchmarks corresponding to well-established and recently labeled ADRs respectively are used to evaluate the performance of multimodal signal detection in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC) and lead-time-to-detection, with the latter relative to labeling revision dates. RESULTS: Limited to our reference benchmarks, multimodal signal detection provides AUC improvements ranging from 0.04 to 0.09 based on a widely used evaluation benchmark, and a comparative added lead-time of 7-22 months relative to labeling revision dates from a time-indexed benchmark. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the notion that utilizing and jointly analyzing multiple data sources may lead to improved signal detection. Given certain data and benchmark limitations, the early stage of development, and the complexity of ADRs, it is currently not possible to make definitive statements about the ultimate utility of the concept. Continued development of multimodal signal detection requires a deeper understanding the data sources used, additional benchmarks, and further research on methods to generate and synthesize signals.", "meshT": "['*Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems', 'Databases, Factual', 'Humans', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']", "source": "J Biomed Inform. 2017 Dec;76:41-49. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2017.10.013.

This study explored risk prediction models for ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patients without AF. METHODS: Three US-based healthcare databases (Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters [CCAE], Medicare Supplemental [MDCR], and Optum Clinformatics [Optum]) were used to establish patient cohorts without AF during the index period of 2008-2012. The performance of 2 existing models (CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc) for predicting stroke and TIA was examined by fitting a logistic regression to a training dataset and evaluating predictive accuracy in a validation dataset (area under the curve, AUC) using patients with complete follow-up of 1 or 3 years, separately. RESULTS: The commercial populations were younger and had fewer comorbidities than Medicare-eligible population. The incidence proportions of ischemic stroke and TIA during 1 and 3 years of follow-up were .5% and 1.9% (CCAE), .6% and 2.2% (Optum), and 4.6% and 13.1% (MDCR), respectively. The models performed consistently across all 3 databases, with the AUC ranging from .69 to .77 and from .68 to .73 for 1- and 3-year prediction, respectively. Predictive accuracy was lower than the initial work of CHADS2 evaluation in patients with AF (AUC: .82), but consistent with a subsequent meta-analysis of CHADS2 (.60-.80) and CHA2DS2-VASc performance (.64-.79).

We sought to understand current practices and attitudes towards reporting data quality assessment (DQA) results by data professionals. METHODS: The project was conducted in four Phases: (1) examined current DQA practices among informatics/CER stakeholders via engagement meeting (07/2014); (2) characterized organizations conducting DQA by interviewing key personnel and data management professionals (07-08/2014); (3) developed and administered an anonymous survey to data professionals (03-06/2015); and (4) validated survey results during a follow-up informatics/CER stakeholder engagement meeting (06/2016). RESULTS: The first engagement meeting identified the theme of unintended consequences as a primary barrier to DQA. Interviewees were predominantly medical groups serving distributed networks with formalized DQAs. Consistent with the interviews, most survey (N=111) respondents utilized DQA processes/programs. A lack of resources and clear definitions of how to judge the quality of a dataset were the most commonly cited individual barriers. Vague quality action plans/expectations and data owners not trained in problem identification and problem-solving skills were the most commonly cited organizational barriers. Solutions included allocating resources for DQA, establishing standards and guidelines, and changing organizational culture. DISCUSSION: Several barriers affecting DQA and reporting were identified. Community alignment towards systematic DQA and reporting is needed to overcome these barriers.

This study presents a range of data quality issues identified over a period of 18 months and interprets them to evaluate the research capacity of PEDSnet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Results were generated by a semiautomated data quality assessment workflow. Two investigators reviewed programmatic data quality issues and conducted discussions with the data partners' extract-transform-load analysts to determine the cause for each issue. RESULTS: The results include a longitudinal summary of 2182 data quality issues identified across 9 data submission cycles. The metadata from the most recent cycle includes annotations for 850 issues: most frequent types, including missing data (>300) and outliers (>100); most complex domains, including medications (>160) and lab measurements (>140); and primary causes, including source data characteristics (83%) and extract-transform-load errors (9%). DISCUSSION: The longitudinal findings demonstrate the network's evolution from identifying difficulties with aligning the data to a common data model to learning norms in clinical pediatrics and determining research capability.

METHODS: A new-user cohort study design using a large insurance claims database in the US. DKA incidence was compared between new users of SGLT2i and new users of non-SGLT2i AHAs pair-matched on exposure propensity scores (EPS) using Cox regression models. RESULTS: Overall, crude incidence rates (95% CI) per 1000 patient-years for DKA were 1.69 (1.22-2.30) and 1.83 (1.58-2.10) among new users of SGLT2i (n=34,442) and non-SGLT2i AHAs (n=126,703).

The hazard ratio (95% CI) for DKA comparing new users of SGLT2i to new users of non-SGLT2i AHAs was 1.91 (0.94-4.11) (p=0.09) among the 30,196 EPS-matched pairs overall, and 1.13 (0.43-3.00) (p=0.81) among the 27,515 EPS-matched pairs that excluded PAD. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first observational study that compared DKA risk between new users of SGLT2i and non-SGLT2i AHAs among patients with type 2 diabetes, and overall no statistically significant difference was detected.", "meshT": "['Cohort Studies', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors']", "source": "Diabetes Res Clin Pract. 2017 Jun;128:83-90. doi: 10.1016/j.diabres.2017.04.004.

Prior observational studies estimating the risks associated with paracetamol use acknowledge the inherent limitations of these studies. One threat to the validity of observational studies is channeling bias, i.e. the notion that patients are systematically exposed to one drug or the other, based on current and past comorbidities, in a manner that affects estimated relative risk. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine whether evidence of channeling bias exists in observational studies that compare paracetamol with ibuprofen, and, if so, the extent to which confounding adjustment can mitigate this bias. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In a cohort of 140,770 patients, we examined whether those who received any paracetamol (including concomitant users) were more likely to have prior diagnoses of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or renal disease than those who received ibuprofen alone. We compared propensity score distributions between drugs, and examined the degree to which channeling bias could be controlled using a combination of negative control disease outcome models and large-scale propensity score matching. Analyses were conducted using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. RESULTS: The proportions of prior MI, GI bleeding, renal disease, and stroke were significantly higher in those prescribed any paracetamol versus ibuprofen alone, after adjusting for sex and age. We were not able to adequately remove selection bias using a selected set of covariates for propensity score adjustment; however, when we fit the propensity score model using a substantially larger number of covariates, evidence of residual bias was attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: Although using selected covariates for propensity score adjustment may not sufficiently reduce bias, large-scale propensity score matching offers a novel approach to consider to mitigate the effects of channeling bias.", "meshT": "['Acetaminophen/*adverse effects', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/statistics & numerical data', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analgesics/*adverse effects', 'Bias', 'Cohort Studies', 'Databases, Factual', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Ibuprofen/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nonprescription Drugs/*adverse effects', 'Propensity Score', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']", "source": "Drug Saf. 2017 Dec;40(12):1279-1292. doi: 10.1007/s40264-017-0581-7.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Rachel B Weinstein' 'Patrick Ryan' 'Jesse A Berlin' 'Amy Matcho' 'Martijn Schuemie' 'Joel Swerdel' 'Kayur Patel' 'Daniel Fife'", "firstAuthor": "'Rachel B Weinstein", "pubYear": 2017, "titleAuthorStr": "Channeling in the Use of Nonprescription Paracetamol and Ibuprofen in an Electronic Medical Records Database: Evidence and Implications.

In light of these findings, the objective of the current study was to further investigate the risks of AKI and related outcomes among older adults receiving AAPs. METHODS: A replication of the previously published analysis was performed using the US Truven MarketScan Medicare Supplemental database (MDCR) among patients aged 65 years and older. Compared with non-users of AAPs, the study compared the risk of AKI and related outcomes with users of AAPs (quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, or paliperidone) using a 1-to-1 propensity score matched analysis. In addition, we performed adapted analyses that: (1) included all covariates used to fit propensity score models in outcome models; and (2) required patients to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression and a healthcare visit within 90 days prior to the index date. RESULTS: AKI effect estimates [as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] were significantly elevated in our MDCR replication analyses (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.32-1.60); however, in adapted analyses, associations were not significant (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78-1.07)). In analyses of AKI and related outcomes, results were mostly consistent between the previously published and the MDCR replication analyses. The primary change that attenuated associations in adapted analyses was the requirement for patients to have a mental health condition and a healthcare visit prior to the index date. CONCLUSIONS: The MDCR analysis yielded similar results when the methodology of the previously published analysis was replicated, but, in adapted analyses, we did not find significantly higher risks of AKI and related outcomes. The contrast of results between our replication and adapted analyses may be due to the analytic approach used to compare patients (and potential confounding by indication).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with T2DM newly exposed to SGLT2 inhibitors or non-SGLT2 inhibitor AHAs were identified using the Truven MarketScan database. The incidence of below-knee lower extremity (BKLE) amputation was calculated for patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, canagliflozin, or non-SGLT2 inhibitor AHAs. Patients newly exposed to canagliflozin and non-SGLT2 inhibitor AHAs were matched 1:1 on propensity scores, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used for comparative analysis.

Patients who do not respond to antidepressants have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Predicting who will develop TRD may help healthcare providers make more effective treatment decisions. We sought to identify factors that predict TRD in a real-world setting using claims databases. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a US claims database of adult subjects with newly diagnosed and treated depression with no mania, dementia, and psychosis. The index date was the date of antidepressant dispensing. The outcome was TRD, defined as having at least three distinct antidepressants or one antidepressant and one antipsychotic within 1 year after the index date. Predictors were age, gender, medical conditions, medications, and procedures 1 year before the index date. RESULTS: Of 230,801 included patients, 10.4% developed TRD within 1 year. TRD patients at baseline were younger; 10.87% were between 18 and 19 years old versus 7.64% in the no-TRD group, risk ratio (RR) = 1.42 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-1.48). TRD patients were more likely to have an anxiety disorder at baseline than non-TRD patients, RR = 1.38 (95% CI 1.35-1.14). At 3.68, fatigue had the highest RR (95% CI 3.18-4.25). TRD patients had substance use disorders, psychiatric conditions, insomnia, and pain more often at baseline than non-TRD patients. CONCLUSION: Ten percent of subjects newly diagnosed and treated for depression developed TRD within a year.

Reliable frameworks are needed to determine relative propensity score performance in large-scale studies, and to establish optimal propensity score model selection methods. Methods: We detail a propensity score evaluation framework that includes synthetic and real-world data experiments. Our synthetic experimental design extends the 'plasmode' framework and simulates survival data under known effect sizes, and our real-world experiments use a set of negative control outcomes with presumed null effect sizes. In reproductions of two published cohort studies, we compare two propensity score estimation methods that contrast in their model selection approach: L1-regularized regression that conducts a penalized likelihood regression, and the 'high-dimensional propensity score' (hdPS) that employs a univariate covariate screen. We evaluate methods on a range of outcome-dependent and outcome-independent metrics. Results: L1-regularization propensity score methods achieve superior model fit, covariate balance and negative control bias reduction compared with the hdPS. Simulation results are mixed and fluctuate with simulation parameters, revealing a limitation of simulation under the proportional hazards framework. Including regularization with the hdPS reduces commonly reported non-convergence issues but has little effect on propensity score performance.

METHODS: The Truven Health Analytics MarketScan((R)) database was used to identify 190 894 individuals with bipolar or schizoaffective disorder who filled a prescription for one of 29 drugs of interest: lithium, first- or second-generation antipsychotics, mood-stabilizing anticonvulsants, and antidepressants. Competing risks regression survival analysis was used to compare drugs for risk of psychiatric hospitalization, adjusting for patient age, sex, comorbidities, and pretreatment medications. Other competing risks were ending monotherapy and non-psychiatric hospitalization. RESULTS: Three drugs were associated with significantly lower risk of psychiatric hospitalization than lithium: valproate (relative risk [RR] = 0.80, P = 3.20 x 10(-4) ), aripiprazole (RR = 0.80, P = 3.50 x 10(-4) ), and bupropion (RR = 0.80, P = 2.80 x 10(-4) ). Eight drugs were associated with significantly higher risk of psychiatric hospitalization: haloperidol (RR = 1.57, P = 9.40 x 10(-4) ), clozapine (RR = 1.52, P = .017), fluoxetine (RR = 1.17, P = 3.70 x 10(-3) ), sertraline (RR = 1.17, P = 3.20 x 10(-3) ), citalopram (RR = 1.14, P = .013), duloxetine (RR = 1.24, P = 5.10 x 10(-4) ), venlafaxine (RR = 1.33; P = 1.00 x 10(-6) ), and ziprasidone (RR = 1.25; P = 6.20 x 10(-3) ). CONCLUSIONS: This largest reported retrospective observational study on bipolar disorders pharmacotherapy to date demonstrates that the majority of patients end monotherapy within 2 months after treatment start. The risk of psychiatric hospitalization varied almost two-fold across individual medications. The data add to the evidence favoring lithium and mood stabilizer use in short-term bipolar disorder management. The findings that the dopaminergic drugs aripiprazole and bupropion had better outcomes than other members of their respective classes and that antidepressant outcomes may vary by baseline mood polarity merit further investigation.", "meshT": "['Adult', 'Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use', 'Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antimanic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Lithium Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychotic Disorders/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk']", "source": "Bipolar Disord. 2018 Dec;20(8):761-771. doi: 10.1111/bdi.12665.

This study examined the real-world comparative effectiveness within the SGLT2i class and compared with non-SGLT2i antihyperglycaemic agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 4 large US administrative claims databases were used to characterize risk and provide population-level estimates of canagliflozin's effects on hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) and BKLE amputation vs other SGLT2i and non-SGLT2i in T2DM patients. Comparative analyses using a propensity score-adjusted new-user cohort design examined relative hazards of outcomes across all new users and a subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: Across the 4 databases (142 800 new users of canagliflozin, 110 897 new users of other SGLT2i, 460 885 new users of non-SGLT2i), the meta-analytic hazard ratio estimate for HHF with canagliflozin vs non-SGLT2i was 0.39 (95% CI, 0.26-0.60) in the on-treatment analysis. The estimate for BKLE amputation with canagliflozin vs non-SGLT2i was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.40-1.41) in the on-treatment analysis and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.93-1.10) in the intent-to-treat analysis. Effects in the subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease were similar for both outcomes. No consistent differences were observed between canagliflozin and other SGLT2i. CONCLUSIONS: In this large comprehensive analysis, canagliflozin and other SGLT2i demonstrated HHF benefits consistent with clinical trial data, but showed no increased risk of BKLE amputation vs non-SGLT2i. HHF and BKLE amputation results were similar in the subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease.

Here, we demonstrate an open-source predictive analytics platform that applies machine-learning techniques to a common data model; we develop and validate a predictive model of antihyperglycemic medication cessation (validated proxy for A1c control) in patients with treated T2D who underwent MxS. METHODS: We selected patients meeting the following criteria in 2 large US healthcare claims databases (Truven Health MarketScan Commercial [CCAE]; Optum Clinformatics [Optum]): underwent MxS between January 1, 2007, to October 1, 2013 (first = index); aged >/=18 years; continuous enrollment 180 days pre-index (baseline) to 730 days postindex; baseline T2D diagnosis and treatment. The outcome was no antihyperglycemic medication treatment from 365 to 730 days after MxS. A regularized logistic regression model was trained using the following candidate predictor categories measured at baseline: demographics, conditions, medications, measurements, and procedures. A 75% to 25% split of the CCAE group was used for model training and testing; the Optum group was used for external validation. RESULTS: 13 050 (CCAE) and 3477 (Optum) patients met the study inclusion criteria. Antihyperglycemic medication cessation rates were 72.9% (CCAE) and 70.8% (Optum). The model possessed good internal discriminative accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.778 [95% CI = 0.761-0.795] in CCAE test set N = 3527) and transportability (external AUC = 0.759 [95% CI = 0.741-0.777] in Optum N = 3477).

Following the successful integration of the i2b2 research data repository in MIRACUM, we present a standardized and generic DQ framework. STATE OF THE ART: Already established DQ evaluation methods do not cover all of MIRACUM's requirements. CONCEPT: A data quality analysis plan was developed to assess common data quality dimensions for demographic-, condition-, procedure- and department-related variables of MIRACUM's research data repository. IMPLEMENTATION: A data quality analysis (DQA) tool was developed using R scripts packaged in a Docker image with all the necessary dependencies and R libraries for easy distribution. It integrates with the i2b2 data repository at each MIRACUM site, executes an analysis on the data and generates a DQ report. LESSONS LEARNED: Our DQA tool brings the analysis to the data and thus meets the MIRACUM data protection requirements. It evaluates established DQ dimensions of data repositories in a standardized and easily distributable way. This analysis allowed us to reveal and revise inconsistencies in earlier versions of the ETL jobs. The framework is portable, easy to deploy across different sites and even further adaptable to other database schemes. CONCLUSION: The presented framework provides the first step towards a unified, standardized and harmonized EHR DQ assessment in MIRACUM. DQ issues can now be systematically identified by individual hospitals to subsequently implement site- or consortium-wide feedback loops to increase data quality.", "meshT": "['*Data Accuracy', 'Databases, Factual', '*Electronic Health Records']", "source": "Stud Health Technol Inform. 2019 Sep 3;267:247-253. doi: 10.3233/SHTI190834.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Lorenz A Kapsner' 'Marvin O Kampf' 'Susanne A Seuchter' 'Gaetan Kamdje-Wabo' 'Tobias Gradinger' 'Thomas Ganslandt' 'Sebastian Mate' 'Julian Gruendner' 'Detlef Kraska' 'Hans-Ulrich Prokosch'", "firstAuthor": "'Lorenz A Kapsner", "pubYear": 2019, "titleAuthorStr": "Moving Towards an EHR Data Quality Framework: The MIRACUM Approach.

To address the issue of limited clinical data for confounder adjustment, a patient-level prediction model to differentiate between patients prescribed and not prescribed advanced therapies was developed as a surrogate for disease severity, using all available data from a US claims database. METHODS: Data from adult RA patients were used to build regularized logistic regression models to predict current and future disease severity using a biologic or tofacitinib prescription claim as a surrogate for moderate-to-severe disease. Model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver (AUC) operating characteristic curve, tested and trained in Optum Clinformatics(R) Extended DataMart (Optum) and additionally validated in three external IBM MarketScan(R) databases. The model was further validated in the Optum database across a range of patient cohorts. RESULTS: In the Optum database (n = 68,608), the AUC for discriminating RA patients with a prescription claim for a biologic or tofacitinib versus those without in the 90 days following index diagnosis was 0.80. Model AUCs were 0.77 in IBM CCAE (n = 75,579) and IBM MDCD (n = 7,537) and 0.75 in IBM MDCR (n = 36,090). There was little change in the prediction model assessing discrimination 730 days following index diagnosis (prediction model AUC in Optum was 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: A prediction model demonstrated good discrimination across multiple claims databases to identify RA patients with a prescription claim for advanced therapies during different time-at-risk periods as proxy for current and future moderate-to-severe disease. This work provides a robust model-derived risk score that can be used as a potential covariate and proxy measure to adjust for confounding by severity in multivariable models in the RA population. An R package to develop the prediction model and risk score are available in an open source platform for researchers.", "meshT": "['Antirheumatic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/diagnosis/drug therapy/*physiopathology', '*Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Insurance Claim Review', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrroles/administration & dosage', 'Severity of Illness Index']", "source": "PLoS One. 2019 Dec 18;14(12):e0226255. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0226255. eCollection 2019.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Urmila Chandran' 'Jenna Reps' 'Paul E Stang' 'Patrick B Ryan'", "firstAuthor": "'Urmila Chandran", "pubYear": 2019, "titleAuthorStr": "Inferring disease severity in rheumatoid arthritis using predictive modeling in administrative claims databases.

We compared race and ethnicity data collected via administrative processes with data recorded directly by respondents via paper surveys (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems). Respondent-recorded data were considered the gold standard for the collection of race and ethnicity information. RESULTS: Among the 160 million patients from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project and Optum Labs datasets, race or ethnicity was unknown for 25%. Among the 2.4 million patients in the single New York City healthcare system's EHR, race or ethnicity was unknown for 57%. However, when patients directly recorded their race and ethnicity, 86% provided clinically meaningful information, and 66% of patients reported information that was discrepant with the EHR. DISCUSSION: Race and ethnicity data are critical to support precision medicine initiatives and to determine healthcare disparities; however, the quality of this information in observational databases is concerning.

If it was possible to identify patients who are at a higher risk of opioid use disorder, then clinicians could spend more time educating these patients about the risks. We develop and validate a model to predict a person's future risk of opioid use disorder at the point before being dispensed their first opioid. METHODS: A cohort study patient-level prediction using four US claims databases with target populations ranging between 343,552 and 384,424 patients. The outcome was recorded diagnosis of opioid abuse, dependency or unspecified drug abuse as a proxy for opioid use disorder from 1 day until 365 days after the first opioid is dispensed. We trained a regularized logistic regression using candidate predictors consisting of demographics and any conditions, drugs, procedures or visits prior to the first opioid. We then selected the top predictors and created a simple 8 variable score model. RESULTS: We estimated the percentage of new users of opioids with reported opioid use disorder within a year to range between 0.04%-0.26% across US claims data. We developed an 8 variable Calculator of Risk for Opioid Use Disorder (CROUD) score, derived from the prediction models to stratify patients into higher and lower risk groups. The 8 baseline variables were age 15-29, medical history of substance abuse, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, low back pain, renal impairment, painful neuropathy and recent ER visit. 1.8% of people were in the high risk group for opioid use disorder and had a score > = 23 with the model obtaining a sensitivity of 13%, specificity of 98% and PPV of 1.14% for predicting opioid use disorder. CONCLUSIONS: CROUD could be used by clinicians to obtain personalized risk scores.

Despite the high co-occurrence of chronic medical conditions and SUD, little is known about whether chronic condition outcomes or related service utilization in primary care varies between patients with versus without documented SUDs. This study examined whether having a SUD influenced the use of primary care services and common chronic condition outcomes for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort observational study examined electronic health record data from 21 primary care clinics in Washington and Idaho to examine differences in service utilization and clinical outcomes for diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in patients with and without a documented SUD diagnosis. Differences between patients with and without documented SUD diagnoses were compared over a three-year window for clinical outcome measures, including hemoglobin A1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index, as well as service outcome measures, including number of encounters with primary care and co-located behavioral health providers, and orders for prescription opioids. Adult patients (N = 10,175) diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, or obesity before the end of 2014, and who had >/=2 visits across a three-year window including at least one visit in 2014 (baseline) and at least one visit occurring 12 months or longer after the 2014 visit (follow-up) were examined. RESULTS: Patients with SUD diagnoses and co-occurring chronic conditions were seen by providers more frequently than patients without SUD diagnoses (p's < 0.05), and patients with SUD diagnoses were more likely to be prescribed opioid medications. Chronic condition outcomes were no different for patients with versus without SUD diagnoses. DISCUSSION: Despite the higher visit rates to providers in primary care, a majority of patients with SUD diagnoses and chronic medical conditions in primary care did not get seen by co-located behavioral health providers, who can potentially provide and support evidence informed care for both SUD and chronic conditions. Patients with chronic medical conditions also were more likely to get prescribed opioids if they had an SUD diagnosis. Care pathway innovations for SUDs that include greater utilization of evidence-informed co-treatment of SUDs and chronic conditions within primary care settings may be necessary for improving care overall for patients with comorbid SUDs and chronic conditions.", "meshT": "['Adult', 'Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Primary Health Care', '*Substance-Related Disorders/drug therapy/therapy', 'Washington/epidemiology']", "source": "J Subst Abuse Treat. 2020 Mar;112S:49-55. doi: 10.1016/j.jsat.2020.02.008.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Kari A Stephens' 'Imara I West' 'Kevin A Hallgren' 'Brenda Mollis' 'Kris Ma' 'Dennis M Donovan' 'Brenda Stuvek' 'Laura-Mae Baldwin'", "firstAuthor": "'Kari A Stephens", "pubYear": 2020, "titleAuthorStr": "Service utilization and chronic condition outcomes among primary care patients with substance use disorders and co-occurring chronic conditions.

METHOD: A population-based comparative cohort study was conducted using the national claims database. Individuals aged >/=65 years with confirmed COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 10, 2020 were assessed. The endpoints for evaluating mortality for all participants were death, 21 days after diagnosis, or April 10, 2020. The risk of mortality associated with mental disorders was estimated using Cox hazards regression. RESULTS: We identified 814 elderly COVID-19 patients (255 [31.3%] with mental disorder and 559 [68.7%] with nonmental disorder). Individuals with mental disorders were found more likely to be older, taking antithrombotic agents, and had diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease, and urinary tract infections than those without mental disorders. After propensity score stratification, our study included 781 patients in each group (236 [30.2%] with mental disorder and 545 [69.8%] with nonmental disorder). The mental disorder group showed higher mortality rates than the nonmental disorder group (12.7% [30/236] versus 6.8% [37/545]). However, compared to patients without mental disorders, the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality in elderly COVID-19 patients with mental disorders was not statistically significant (HR: 1.57, 95%CI: 0.95-2.56). CONCLUSION: Although the association between mental disorders in elderly individuals and mortality in COVID-19 is unclear, this study suggests that elderly patients with comorbid conditions and those taking psychiatric medications might be at a higher risk of COVID-19.", "meshT": "['Aged', 'Betacoronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', '*Coronavirus Infections/diagnosis/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology/virology', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', '*Pandemics', '*Pneumonia, Viral/diagnosis/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2']", "source": "Am J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2020 Dec;28(12):1308-1316. doi: 10.1016/j.jagp.2020.09.016.

We created an electronic cohort of 1.4 million patients having had at least 4 encounters with a healthcare organization for at least 24-months; were aged >/=18 years in 2010; and had no diabetes (i.e., T1DM or T2DM) at cohort entry or in the 12 months following entry. EHR data came from patients at nine healthcare organizations across the U.S. between January 1, 2010-December 31, 2016. RESULTS: Approximately 5.9% of the LEADR cohort (82,922 patients) developed T2DM, providing opportunities to explore longitudinal clinical care, medication use, risk factor trajectories, and diagnoses for these patients, compared with patients similarly matched prior to disease onset. CONCLUSIONS: LEADR represents one of the largest EHR databases to have repurposed EHR data to examine patients' T2DM risk. This paper is first in a series demonstrating this novel approach to studying T2DM. IMPLICATIONS: Chronic conditions that often take years to develop can be studied efficiently using EHR data in a retrospective design. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: While much is already known about T2DM risk, this EHR's cohort's 160 M data points for 1.4 M people over six years, provides opportunities to investigate new unique risk factors and evaluate research hypotheses where results could modify public health practice for preventing T2DM.", "meshT": "['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Electronic Health Records/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prediabetic State/*diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment/methods/*standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors']", "source": "Healthc (Amst). 2020 Dec;8(4):100458. doi: 10.1016/j.hjdsi.2020.100458.

METHODS: A retrospective multicenter observational study was conducted using a distributed research network to analyze the effect of HCTZ on skin cancer from 2004 to 2018. We performed Cox regression to evaluate the effects by comparing the use of HCTZ with other antihypertensive drugs. All analyses were re-evaluated using matched data using the propensity score matching (PSM). Then, the overall effects were evaluated by combining results with the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Positive associations were observed in the use of HCTZ with high cumulative dose for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in univariate analysis prior to the use of PSM. Some negative associations were observed in the use of low and medium cumulative doses. CONCLUSION: Although many findings in our study were inconclusive, there was a non-significant association of a dose-response pattern with estimates increasing in cumulative dose of HCTZ.

Recently, electronic health care data using the common data model (CDM) have been introduced and commonly adopted in pharmacovigilance research. We aimed to analyze ASD-related ADRs using CDM and to assess the feasibility of CDM analysis in monitoring ADR in a single tertiary hospital. METHODS: We selected five ASDs: oxcarbazepine (OXC), lamotrigine (LTG), levetiracetam (LEV), valproic acid (VPA), and topiramate (TPM). Patients diagnosed with epilepsy and exposed to monotherapy with one of the ASDs before age 18 years were included. We measured four ADR outcomes: (1) hematologic abnormality, (2) hyponatremia, (3) elevation of liver enzymes, and (4) subclinical hypothyroidism. We performed a subgroup analysis to exclude the effects of concomitant medications. RESULTS: From the database, 1344 patients were included for the study. Of the 1344 patients, 436 were receiving OXC, 293 were receiving LTG, 275 were receiving LEV, 180 were receiving VPA, and 160 were receiving TPM. Thrombocytopenia developed in 14.1% of patients taking VPA. Hyponatremia occurred in 10.5% of patients taking OXC. Variable ranges of liver enzyme elevation were detected in 19.3% of patients taking VPA. Subclinical hypothyroidism occurred in approximately 21.5% to 28% of patients with ASD monotherapy, which did not significantly differ according to the type of ASD. In a subgroup analysis, we observed similar ADR tendencies, but with less thrombocytopenia in the TPM group. SIGNIFICANCE: The incidence and trends of ADRs that were evaluated by CDM were similar to the previous literature. CDM can be a useful tool for analyzing ASD-related ADRs in a multicenter study. The strengths and limitations of CDM should be carefully addressed.", "meshT": "['Anticonvulsants/*adverse effects', '*Common Data Elements', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Epilepsy/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Lamotrigine/adverse effects', 'Levetiracetam/adverse effects', 'Oxcarbazepine/adverse effects', 'Topiramate/adverse effects', 'Valproic Acid/adverse effects']", "source": "Epilepsia. 2020 Apr;61(4):610-616. doi: 10.1111/epi.16472.

The estimated odds and hazards ratios for the negative controls show substantial bias in the evaluated design variants, with far fewer of the 95% confidence intervals containing 1 than the nominal 95% expected for negative controls. The effect-size estimates for the cancer outcomes are comparable to those observed for the negative controls.

The aim of this study was to develop a 90-day mortality-risk prediction model for identification of high- and low-risk patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. METHODS: This was a nationwide cohort study using records from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group database that included all patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2015. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression prediction model was developed using 121 pre- and intraoperative variables and internally validated in a hold-out test data set. The accuracy of the model was assessed in terms of discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: In total, 49 607 patients were registered in the database. After exclusion of 16 680 individuals, 32 927 patients were included in the analysis. Overall, 1754 (5.3 per cent) deaths were recorded. Targeting high-risk individuals, the model identified 5.5 per cent of all patients facing a risk of 90-day mortality exceeding 35 per cent, corresponding to a 6.7 times greater risk than the average population. Targeting low-risk individuals, the model identified 20.9 per cent of patients facing a risk less than 0.3 per cent, corresponding to a 17.7 times lower risk compared with the average population. The model exhibited discriminatory power with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 85.3 per cent (95 per cent c.i. 83.6 to 87.0) and excellent calibration with a Brier score of 0.04 and 32 per cent average precision.

Though organizational clinical data are abundant, these are largely inaccessible to outside researchers. Statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. Here, we introduce the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science community focused on analyzing patient-level data from many centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Clinical and Translational Science Award Program and scientific community created N3C to overcome technical, regulatory, policy, and governance barriers to sharing and harmonizing individual-level clinical data. We developed solutions to extract, aggregate, and harmonize data across organizations and data models, and created a secure data enclave to enable efficient, transparent, and reproducible collaborative analytics. RESULTS: Organized in inclusive workstreams, we created legal agreements and governance for organizations and researchers; data extraction scripts to identify and ingest positive, negative, and possible COVID-19 cases; a data quality assurance and harmonization pipeline to create a single harmonized dataset; population of the secure data enclave with data, machine learning, and statistical analytics tools; dissemination mechanisms; and a synthetic data pilot to democratize data access. CONCLUSIONS: The N3C has demonstrated that a multisite collaborative learning health network can overcome barriers to rapidly build a scalable infrastructure incorporating multiorganizational clinical data for COVID-19 analytics. We expect this effort to save lives by enabling rapid collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and data scientists to identify treatments and specialized care and thereby reduce the immediate and long-term impacts of COVID-19.", "meshT": "['*COVID-19', 'Computer Security', 'Data Analysis', 'Data Science/*organization & administration', 'Ethics Committees, Research', 'Government Regulation', 'Humans', '*Information Dissemination', '*Intersectoral Collaboration', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'United States']", "source": "J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2021 Mar 1;28(3):427-443. doi: 10.1093/jamia/ocaa196.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Melissa A Haendel' 'Christopher G Chute' 'Tellen D Bennett' 'David A Eichmann' 'Justin Guinney' 'Warren A Kibbe' 'Philip R O Payne' 'Emily R Pfaff' 'Peter N Robinson' 'Joel H Saltz' 'Heidi Spratt' 'Christine Suver' 'John Wilbanks' 'Adam B Wilcox' 'Andrew E Williams' 'Chunlei Wu' 'Clair Blacketer' 'Robert L Bradford' 'James J Cimino' 'Marshall Clark' 'Evan W Colmenares' 'Patricia A Francis' 'Davera Gabriel' 'Alexis Graves' 'Raju Hemadri' 'Stephanie S Hong' 'George Hripscak' 'Dazhi Jiao' 'Jeffrey G Klann' 'Kristin Kostka' 'Adam M Lee' 'Harold P Lehmann' 'Lora Lingrey' 'Robert T Miller' 'Michele Morris' 'Shawn N Murphy' 'Karthik Natarajan' 'Matvey B Palchuk' 'Usman Sheikh' 'Harold Solbrig' 'Shyam Visweswaran' 'Anita Walden' 'Kellie M Walters' 'Griffin M Weber' 'Xiaohan Tanner Zhang' 'Richard L Zhu' 'Benjamin Amor' 'Andrew T Girvin' 'Amin Manna' 'Nabeel Qureshi' 'Michael G Kurilla' 'Sam G Michael' 'Lili M Portilla' 'Joni L Rutter' 'Christopher P Austin' 'Ken R Gersing'", "firstAuthor": "'Melissa A Haendel", "pubYear": 2020, "titleAuthorStr": "The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C): Rationale, design, infrastructure, and deployment.

METHODS: Three administrative claims databases, IBM MarketScan((R)) Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE), IBM MarketScan((R)) Multi-State Medicare Database (MDCR), and Optum's de-identified Clinformatics((R)) Data Mart Database (Optum) were analyzed. Adults >/=18 years old, with a diagnosis of amyloidosis and evidence of cardiac involvement (i.e. heart failure, heart block, or cardiomyopathy) but no hepatic/renal failure prior to amyloidosis diagnosis were included for analysis. The primary analyses identified patients between 01-01-2010 and 31-12-2017 period. We calculated the rates of hospitalization and in-hospital mortality within 1 year after the initial diagnosis of amyloidosis. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for patients identified in Optum database during 2004-2011 period, which provided additional mortality information. RESULTS: A total of 419, 654, and 922 patients from CCAE, MDCR, and Optum were identified during 2010-2017 period, with mean age of 55.6, 77.8, and 74.2 years, respectively. Within 1 year following initial amyloidosis diagnosis, incidence rates (95% confidence interval [CI]) of hospitalization were 78.4 (66.3, 90.4), 78.6 (69.2, 87.9), and 61.2 (54.4, 68.0) per 100 person-years, rates of in-hospital mortality were 16.5 (11.8, 21.3), 8.4 (5.7, 11.0), and 17.7 (14.5, 21.0) per 100 person-years, in CCAE, MDCR, and Optum, respectively. The mortality rate from the sensitivity analysis among patients identified in Optum 2004-2011 period was higher compared with Optum 2010-2017 period.

The goal of this article is to describe the experience of running a data consult service that generates clinical evidence in real time and characterize the challenges related to its use of observational data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2019, we launched the Data Consult Service pilot with clinicians affiliated with Columbia University Irving Medical Center. We created and implemented a pipeline (question gathering, data exploration, iterative patient phenotyping, study execution, and assessing validity of results) for generating new evidence in real time. We collected user feedback and assessed issues related to producing reliable evidence. RESULTS: We collected 29 questions from 22 clinicians through clinical rounds, emails, and in-person communication. We used validated practices to ensure reliability of evidence and answered 24 of them. Questions differed depending on the collection method, with clinical rounds supporting proactive team involvement and gathering more patient characterization questions and questions related to a current patient. The main challenges we encountered included missing and incomplete data, underreported conditions, and nonspecific coding and accurate identification of drug regimens. CONCLUSIONS: While the Data Consult Service has the potential to generate evidence and facilitate decision making, only a portion of questions can be answered in real time.

Objective: To assess the extent of underlying clinical differences between clinical trial participants and nonparticipants by using a combination of electronic health record and trial enrollment data. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data obtained from a single academic medical center between September 1996 and January 2019 to identify 1645 clinical trial participants from a diverse set of 202 available trials conducted at the center. Using an aggregated resampling procedure, nonparticipants were matched to participants 1:1 based on trial conditions, number of recent visits to a health care professional, and calendar time. Exposures: Clinical trial enrollment vs no enrollment. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was standardized differences in clinical characteristics between participants and nonparticipants in clinical trials stratified into the 4 most common disease domains. Results: This cross-sectional study included 1645 participants from 202 trials (929 [56.5%] male; mean [SD] age, 54.65 [21.38] years) and an aggregated set of 1645 nonparticipants (855 [52.0%] male; mean [SD] age, 57.24 [21.91] years). The most common disease domains for the selected trials were neoplastic disease (86 trials; 737 participants), disorders of the digestive system (31 trials; 321 participants), inflammatory disorders (28 trials; 276 participants), and disorders of the cardiovascular system (27 trials; 319 participants); trials could qualify for multiple disease domains. Among 31 conditions, the percentage of conditions for which the prevalence was lower among participants than among nonparticipants per standardized differences was 64.5% (20 conditions) for neoplastic disease trials, 61.3% (19) for digestive system trials, 58.1% (18) for inflammatory disorder trials, and 38.7% (12) for cardiovascular system trials. Among 17 medications, the percentage of medications for which use was less among participants than among nonparticipants per standardized differences was 64.7% (11) for neoplastic disease trials, 58.8% (10) for digestive system trials, 88.2% (15) for inflammatory disorder trials, and 52.9% (9) for cardiovascular system trials. Conclusions and Relevance: Using a combination of electronic health record and trial enrollment data, this study found that clinical trial participants had fewer comorbidities and less use of medication than nonparticipants across a variety of disease domains.

We compared the incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death and death or intensive services use) among hospitalized famotidine users vs proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users, hydroxychloroquine users, or famotidine nonusers separately. METHODS: We constructed a retrospective cohort study using data from COVID-19 Premier Hospital electronic health records. The study population was COVID-19 hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older. Famotidine, PPI, and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any medication containing 1 of the 3 drugs on the day of admission. The famotidine nonuser group was derived from the same source population with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine as an active ingredient before or on the day of admission. Time at risk was defined based on the intention-to-treat principle starting 1 day after admission to 30 days after admission. For each study comparison group, we fit a propensity score model through large-scale regularized logistic regression. The outcome was modeled using a survival model. RESULTS: We identified 2,193 users of PPI, 5,950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1,816 users of famotidine, and 26,820 nonfamotidine users. After propensity score stratification, the hazard ratios (HRs) for death were as follows: famotidine vs no famotidine HR 1.03 (0.89-1.18), vs PPIs: HR 1.14 (0.94-1.39), and vs hydroxychloroquine: 1.03 (0.85-1.24).

DESIGN: Multinational network cohort study. SETTING: Electronic health records and health claims data from eight countries: Australia, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, mapped to a common data model. PARTICIPANTS: 126 661 070 people observed for at least 365 days before 1 January 2017, 2018, or 2019 from 13 databases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Events of interests were 15 prespecified AESIs (non-haemorrhagic and haemorrhagic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, anaphylaxis, Bell's palsy, myocarditis or pericarditis, narcolepsy, appendicitis, immune thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalomyelitis (including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis), Guillain-Barre syndrome, and transverse myelitis). Incidence rates of AESIs were stratified by age, sex, and database. Rates were pooled across databases using random effects meta-analyses and classified according to the frequency categories of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences. RESULTS: Background rates varied greatly between databases. Deep vein thrombosis ranged from 387 (95% confidence interval 370 to 404) per 100 000 person years in UK CPRD GOLD data to 1443 (1416 to 1470) per 100 000 person years in US IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid data among women aged 65 to 74 years. Some AESIs increased with age. For example, myocardial infarction rates in men increased from 28 (27 to 29) per 100 000 person years among those aged 18-34 years to 1400 (1374 to 1427) per 100 000 person years in those older than 85 years in US Optum electronic health record data. Other AESIs were more common in young people. For example, rates of anaphylaxis among boys and men were 78 (75 to 80) per 100 000 person years in those aged 6-17 years and 8 (6 to 10) per 100 000 person years in those older than 85 years in Optum electronic health record data. Meta-analytic estimates of AESI rates were classified according to age and sex. CONCLUSION: This study found large variations in the observed rates of AESIs by age group and sex, showing the need for stratification or standardisation before using background rates for safety surveillance. Considerable population level heterogeneity in AESI rates was found between databases.", "meshT": "['Adolescent', '*Anaphylaxis', '*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'United States/epidemiology', '*Venous Thrombosis']", "source": "BMJ. 2021 Jun 14;373:n1435. doi: 10.1136/bmj.n1435.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Xintong Li' 'Anna Ostropolets' 'Rupa Makadia' 'Azza Shoaibi' 'Gowtham Rao' 'Anthony G Sena' 'Eugenia Martinez-Hernandez' 'Antonella Delmestri' 'Katia Verhamme' 'Peter R Rijnbeek' 'Talita Duarte-Salles' 'Marc A Suchard' 'Patrick B Ryan' 'George Hripcsak' 'Daniel Prieto-Alhambra'", "firstAuthor": "'Xintong Li", "pubYear": 2022, "titleAuthorStr": "Characterising the background incidence rates of adverse events of special interest for covid-19 vaccines in eight countries: multinational network cohort study.

Patients treated with esketamine were identified and their baseline characteristics described and compared with the baseline characteristics of patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD) and with patients undergoing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). To quantify the differences, standardized mean differences were calculated. RESULTS: In the commercially insured database, 418 patients were treated with esketamine and 830,047 patients were in the TRD group. Large differences in baseline characteristics were observed. Patients in the esketamine group were more likely to have severe depression, suicidal thoughts, and prior treatments with TMS or electroconvulsive therapy than the TRD control group. Patients in the esketamine group had more comorbid psychiatric conditions (anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorders, substance use disorders) and higher exposure to antipsychotics, antiepileptics, hypnotics and sedatives. In terms of general health, patients in the esketamine group had many more outpatient visits, were more likely to have chronic pain and higher Charlson comorbidity scores, a predicator of mortality.

The current study proposes a framework for large-scale CM (LS-CM); and compares large-scale PSM (LS-PSM) and LS-CM in terms of post-match sample size, covariate balance and residual confounding at progressively smaller sample sizes. METHODS: Evaluation of LS-PSM and LS-CM within a comparative cohort study of new users of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic monotherapy identified from a U.S. insurance claims database. Candidate covariates included patient demographics, and all observed prior conditions, drug exposures and procedures. Propensity scores were calculated using LASSO regression, and candidate covariates with non-zero beta coefficients in the propensity model were defined as matching covariates for use in LS-CM. One-to-one matching was performed using progressively tighter parameter settings. Covariate balance was assessed using standardized mean differences. Hazard ratios for negative control outcomes perceived as unassociated with treatment (i.e., true hazard ratio of 1) were estimated using unconditional Cox models. Residual confounding was assessed using the expected systematic error of the empirical null distribution of negative control effect estimates compared to the ground truth. To simulate diverse research conditions, analyses were repeated within 10 %, 1 and 0.5 % subsample groups with increasingly limited covariate overlap. RESULTS: A total of 172,117 patients (ACEI: 129,078; thiazide: 43,039) met the study criteria. As compared to LS-PSM, LS-CM was associated with increased sample retention. Although LS-PSM achieved balance across all matching covariates within the full study population, substantial matching covariate imbalance was observed within the 1 and 0.5 % subsample groups. Meanwhile, LS-CM achieved matching covariate balance across all analyses. LS-PSM was associated with better candidate covariate balance within the full study population. Otherwise, both matching techniques achieved comparable candidate covariate balance and expected systematic error.

RESEARCH DESIGN: We tested the disproportionality design in 5 real observational healthcare databases and 6 simulated datasets, retrospectively studying the predictive accuracy of the method when applied to a collection of 165 positive controls and 234 negative controls across 4 outcomes: acute liver injury, acute myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. MEASURES: We estimate how well the method can be expected to identify true effects and discriminate from false findings and explore the statistical properties of the estimates the design generates. The primary measure was the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: For each combination of 4 outcomes and 5 databases, 48 versions of disproportionality analysis (DPA) were carried out and the AUC computed. The majority of the AUC values were in the range of 0.35 < AUC < 0.6, which is considered to be poor predictive accuracy, since the value AUC = 0.5 would be expected from mere random assignment. Several DPA versions achieved AUC of about 0.7 for the outcome Acute Renal Failure within the GE database. The overall highest DPA version across all 20 outcome-database combinations was the Bayesian Information Component method with no stratification by age and gender, using first occurrence of outcome and with assumed time-at-risk equal to duration of exposure + 30 d, but none were uniformly optimal. The relative risk estimates for the negative control drug-event combinations were very often biased either upward or downward by a factor of 2 or more.

In this paper, we systematically study heterogeneity among databases, holding other study methods constant, by exploring relative risk estimates for 53 drug-outcome pairs and 2 widely used study designs (cohort studies and self-controlled case series) across 10 observational databases. When holding the study design constant, our analysis shows that estimated relative risks range from a statistically significant decreased risk to a statistically significant increased risk in 11 of 53 (21%) of drug-outcome pairs that use a cohort design and 19 of 53 (36%) of drug-outcome pairs that use a self-controlled case series design. This exceeds the proportion of pairs that were consistent across databases in both direction and statistical significance, which was 9 of 53 (17%) for cohort studies and 5 of 53 (9%) for self-controlled case series.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of SCCS and its design choices as a tool for risk identification in observational healthcare data. RESEARCH DESIGN: We examined the risk identification performance of SCCS across five design choices using 399 drug-health outcome pairs in five real observational databases (four administrative claims and one electronic health records). In these databases, the pairs involve 165 positive controls and 234 negative controls. We also consider several synthetic databases with known relative risks between drug-outcome pairs. MEASURES: We evaluate risk identification performance through estimating the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC) and bias and coverage probability in the synthetic examples. RESULTS: The SCCS achieves strong predictive performance. Twelve of the twenty health outcome-database scenarios return AUCs >0.75 across all drugs. Including all adverse events instead of just the first per patient and applying a multivariate adjustment for concomitant drug use are the most important design choices. However, the SCCS as applied here returns relative risk point-estimates biased towards the null value of 1 with low coverage probability.

The self-controlled cohort analysis within the Temporal Pattern Discovery framework compares the observed-to-expected ratio of medical outcomes during post-exposure surveillance periods with those during a set of distinct pre-exposure control periods in the same patients. It utilizes an external control group to account for systematic differences between the different time periods, thus combining within- and between-patient confounder adjustment in a single measure. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the calibrated self-controlled cohort analysis within Temporal Pattern Discovery as a tool for risk identification in observational healthcare data. RESEARCH DESIGN: Different implementations of the calibrated self-controlled cohort analysis were applied to 399 drug-outcome pairs (165 positive and 234 negative test cases across 4 health outcomes of interest) in 5 real observational databases (four with administrative claims and one with electronic health records). MEASURES: Performance was evaluated on real data through sensitivity/specificity, the area under receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC), and bias. RESULTS: The calibrated self-controlled cohort analysis achieved good predictive accuracy across the outcomes and databases under study. The optimal design based on this reference set uses a 360 days surveillance period and a single control period 180 days prior to new prescriptions. It achieved an average AUC of 0.75 and AUC >0.70 in all but one scenario. A design with three separate control periods performed better for the electronic health records database and for acute renal failure across all data sets. The estimates for negative test cases were generally unbiased, but a minor negative bias of up to 0.2 on the RR-scale was observed with the configurations using multiple control periods, for acute liver injury and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recently, the Longitudinal Gamma Poisson Shrinker (LGPS) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Observational Profiles of Adverse events Related to Drugs (LEOPARD) methods were developed specifically for this task. LGPS applies Bayesian shrinkage to an estimated incidence rate ratio, and LEOPARD aims to detect and discard associations due to protopathic bias. The operating characteristics of these methods still need to be determined. OBJECTIVE: Establish the operating characteristics of LGPS and LEOPARD for large scale observational analysis in drug safety. RESEARCH DESIGN: We empirically evaluated LGPS and LEOPARD in five real observational healthcare databases and six simulated datasets. We retrospectively studied the predictive accuracy of the methods when applied to a collection of 165 positive control and 234 negative control drug-outcome pairs across four outcomes: acute liver injury, acute myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. RESULTS: In contrast to earlier findings, we found that LGPS and LEOPARD provide weak discrimination between positive and negative controls, although the use of LEOPARD does lead to higher performance in this respect. Furthermore, the methods produce biased estimates and confidence intervals that have poor coverage properties. CONCLUSIONS: For the four outcomes we examined, LGPS and LEOPARD may not be the designs of choice for risk identification.", "meshT": "['Area Under Curve', 'Bias', 'Databases, Factual', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Probability', '*Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment/*methods']", "source": "Drug Saf. 2013 Oct;36 Suppl 1:S133-42. doi: 10.1007/s40264-013-0107-x.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Martijn J Schuemie' 'David Madigan' 'Patrick B Ryan'", "firstAuthor": "'Martijn J Schuemie", "pubYear": 2013, "titleAuthorStr": "Empirical performance of LGPS and LEOPARD: lessons for developing a risk identification and analysis system.

Observational research is particularly useful in studying rare medical outcomes such as ALI; however, case definitions for ALI in previous observational studies lack consistency and sensitivity. ALI is a clinically important condition with various aetiologies, including drug exposure. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate four distinct case definitions for ALI across a diverse set of large observational databases, providing a better understanding of ALI prevalence and natural history. DATA SOURCES: Seven healthcare databases: GE Healthcare, MarketScan((R)) Lab Database, Humana Inc., Partners HealthCare System, Regenstrief Institute, SDI Health (now IMS Health, Inc.), and the National Patient Care Database of the Veterans Health Administration. METHODS: We evaluated prevalence of ALI through the application of four distinct case definitions across seven observational healthcare databases. We described how laboratory and clinical characteristics of identified case populations varied across definitions and examined the prevalence of other hepatobiliary disorders among identified ALI cases that may decrease suspicion of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in particular. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that increasing the restrictiveness of the case definition resulted in fewer cases, but greater prevalence of ALI clinical features. Considerable heterogeneity in the frequency of laboratory testing and results observed among cases meeting the most restrictive definition suggests that the clinical features, monitoring patterns and suspicion of ALI are highly variable among patients. CONCLUSIONS: Creation of four distinct case definitions and application across a disparate set of observational databases resulted in significant variation in the prevalence of ALI. A greater understanding of the natural history of ALI through examination of electronic healthcare data can facilitate development of reliable and valid ALI case definitions that may enhance the ability to accurately identify associations between ALI and drug exposures. Considerable heterogeneity in laboratory values and frequency of laboratory testing among individuals meeting the criteria for ALI suggests that the evaluation of ALI is highly variable.", "meshT": "['Adult', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', '*Databases, Factual', 'Diagnostic Tests, Routine', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'United States/epidemiology']", "source": "Drug Saf. 2013 Aug;36(8):651-61. doi: 10.1007/s40264-013-0060-8.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Aaron J Katz' 'Patrick B Ryan' 'Judith A Racoosin' 'Paul E Stang'", "firstAuthor": "'Aaron J Katz", "pubYear": 2013, "titleAuthorStr": "Assessment of case definitions for identifying acute liver injury in large observational databases.

The aim of the study was to perform a large-scale descriptive characterization of COVID-19 patients with asthma.Methods: We included nine databases contributing data from January to June 2020 from the US, South Korea (KR), Spain, UK and the Netherlands. We defined two cohorts of COVID-19 patients ('diagnosed' and 'hospitalized') based on COVID-19 disease codes. We followed patients from COVID-19 index date to 30 days or death. We performed descriptive analysis and reported the frequency of characteristics and outcomes in people with asthma defined by codes and prescriptions.Results: The diagnosed and hospitalized cohorts contained 666,933 and 159,552 COVID-19 patients respectively. Exacerbation in people with asthma was recorded in 1.6-8.6% of patients at presentation. Asthma prevalence ranged from 6.2% (95% CI 5.7-6.8) to 18.5% (95% CI 18.2-18.8) in the diagnosed cohort and 5.2% (95% CI 4.0-6.8) to 20.5% (95% CI 18.6-22.6) in the hospitalized cohort. Asthma patients with COVID-19 had high prevalence of comorbidity including hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and obesity. Mortality ranged from 2.1% (95% CI 1.8-2.4) to 16.9% (95% CI 13.8-20.5) and similar or lower compared to COVID-19 patients without asthma. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in 15-30% of hospitalized COVID-19 asthma patients.Conclusion: The prevalence of asthma among COVID-19 patients varies internationally. Asthma patients with COVID-19 have high comorbidity. The prevalence of asthma exacerbation at presentation was low. Whilst mortality was similar among COVID-19 patients with and without asthma, this could be confounded by differences in clinical characteristics. Further research could help identify high-risk asthma patients.[Box: see text]Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/02770903.2021.2025392 .", "meshT": "nan", "source": "J Asthma. 2022 Feb 11:1-11. doi: 10.1080/02770903.2021.2025392.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Daniel R Morales' 'Anna Ostropolets' 'Lana Lai' 'Anthony Sena' 'Scott Duvall' 'Marc Suchard' 'Katia Verhamme' 'Peter Rjinbeek' 'Joe Posada' 'Waheed Ahmed' 'Thamer Alshammary' 'Heba Alghoul' 'Osaid Alser' 'Carlos Areia' 'Clair Blacketer' 'Edward Burn' 'Paula Casajust' 'Seng Chan You' 'Dalia Dawoud' 'Asieh Golozar' 'Menchung Gong' 'Jitendra Jonnagaddala' 'Kristine Lynch' 'Michael Matheny' 'Evan Minty' 'Fredrik Nyberg' 'Albert Uribe' 'Martina Recalde' 'Christian Reich' 'Martijn Scheumie' 'Karishma Shah' 'Nigam Shah' 'Lisa Schilling' 'David Vizcaya' 'Lin Zhang' 'George Hripcsak' 'Patrick Ryan' 'Daniel Prieto-Alhambra' 'Talita Durate-Salles' 'Kristin Kostka'", "firstAuthor": "'Daniel R Morales", "pubYear": 2022, "titleAuthorStr": "Characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with and without asthma from the United States, South Korea, and Europe.

Evaluating drug safety is especially challenging in children due to the processes of growth and maturation, which can alter how children respond to treatment. Current drug safety-signal-detection methods do not account for these dynamics. METHODS: We recently developed a method called disproportionality generalized additive models (dGAMs) to better identify safety signals for drugs across child-development stages. FINDINGS: We used dGAMs on a database of 264,453 pediatric adverse-event reports and found 19,438 ADEs signals associated with development and validated these signals against a small reference set of pediatric ADEs. Using our approach, we can hypothesize on the ontogenic dynamics of ADE signals, such as that montelukast-induced psychiatric disorders appear most significant in the second year of life. Additionally, we integrated pediatric enzyme expression data and found that pharmacogenes with dynamic childhood expression, such as CYP2C18 and CYP27B1, are associated with pediatric ADEs. CONCLUSIONS: We curated KidSIDES, a database of pediatric drug safety signals, for the research community and developed the Pediatric Drug Safety portal (PDSportal) to facilitate evaluation of drug safety signals across childhood growth and development.

Large observational databases often contain temporal medical data for large and diverse populations of patients. It may be possible to learn prognostic models using the large observational data. Often the performance of a prognostic model undesirably worsens when transported to a different database (or into a clinical setting). In this study we investigate different ensemble approaches that combine prognostic models independently developed using different databases (a simple federated learning approach) to determine whether ensembles that combine models developed across databases can improve model transportability (perform better in new data than single database models)? METHODS: For a given prediction question we independently trained five single database models each using a different observational healthcare database. We then developed and investigated numerous ensemble models (fusion, stacking and mixture of experts) that combined the different database models. Performance of each model was investigated via discrimination and calibration using a leave one dataset out technique, i.e., hold out one database to use for validation and use the remaining four datasets for model development. The internal validation of a model developed using the hold out database was calculated and presented as the 'internal benchmark' for comparison. RESULTS: In this study the fusion ensembles generally outperformed the single database models when transported to a previously unseen database and the performances were more consistent across unseen databases. Stacking ensembles performed poorly in terms of discrimination when the labels in the unseen database were limited. Calibration was consistently poor when both ensembles and single database models were applied to previously unseen databases. CONCLUSION: A simple federated learning approach that implements ensemble techniques to combine models independently developed across different databases for the same prediction question may improve the discriminative performance in new data (new database or clinical setting) but will need to be recalibrated using the new data.

Systematic research on sensitivity of rates to the choice of the study parameters is lacking. Materials and Methods: We used 12 data sources to systematically examine the influence of age, race, sex, database, time-at-risk, season and year, prior observation and clean window on incidence rates using 15 adverse events of special interest for COVID-19 vaccines as an example. For binary comparisons we calculated incidence rate ratios and performed random-effect meta-analysis. Results: We observed a wide variation of background rates that goes well beyond age and database effects previously observed. While rates vary up to a factor of 1,000 across age groups, even after adjusting for age and sex, the study showed residual bias due to the other parameters. Rates were highly influenced by the choice of anchoring (e.g., health visit, vaccination, or arbitrary date) for the time-at-risk start. Anchoring on a healthcare encounter yielded higher incidence comparing to a random date, especially for short time-at-risk. Incidence rates were highly influenced by the choice of the database (varying by up to a factor of 100), clean window choice and time-at-risk duration, and less so by secular or seasonal trends. Conclusion: Comparing background to observed rates requires appropriate adjustment and careful time-at-risk start and duration choice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Criteria2Query (C2Q) 2.0 was developed to enable real-time user intervention for criteria selection and simplification, parsing error correction, and concept mapping. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of enhanced modules for negation scope detection, temporal and value normalization were evaluated using a previously curated gold standard, the annotated eligibility criteria of 1010 COVID-19 clinical trials. The usability and usefulness were evaluated by 10 research coordinators in a task-oriented usability evaluation using 5 Alzheimer's disease trials. Data were collected by user interaction logging, a demographic questionnaire, the Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale (Health-ITUES), and a feature-specific questionnaire. RESULTS: The accuracies of negation scope detection, temporal and value normalization were 0.924, 0.916, and 0.966, respectively. C2Q 2.0 achieved a moderate usability score (3.84 out of 5) and a high learnability score (4.54 out of 5). On average, 9.9 modifications were made for a clinical study. Experienced researchers made more modifications than novice researchers. The most frequent modification was deletion (5.35 per study). Furthermore, the evaluators favored cohort queries resulting from modifications (score 4.1 out of 5) and the user engagement features (score 4.3 out of 5).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We empirically assess the effect of sample size on prediction performance and model complexity by generating learning curves for 81 prediction problems (23 outcomes predicted in a depression cohort, 58 outcomes predicted in a hypertension cohort) in three large observational health databases, requiring training of 17,248 prediction models. The adequate sample size was defined as the sample size for which the performance of a model equalled the maximum model performance minus a small threshold value. RESULTS: The adequate sample size achieves a median reduction of the number of observations of 9.5%, 37.3%, 58.5%, and 78.5% for the thresholds of 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02, respectively. The median reduction of the number of predictors in the models was 8.6%, 32.2%, 48.2%, and 68.3% for the thresholds of 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02, respectively. DISCUSSION: Based on our results a conservative, yet significant, reduction in sample size and model complexity can be estimated for future prediction work. Though, if a researcher is willing to generate a learning curve a much larger reduction of the model complexity may be possible as suggested by a large outcome-dependent variability.

DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Retrospective cohort study from 2018 to 2021 using the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) database in Catalonia, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: 3 640 204 individuals aged 18 or older in SIDIAP on 1 March 2018 with no history of anxiety and depressive disorders. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: The incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders during the prelockdown period (March 2018-February 2020), lockdown period (March-June 2020) and postlockdown period (July 2020-March 2021) was calculated. Forecasted rates over the COVID-19 periods were estimated using negative binomial regression models based on prelockdown data. The percentage of reduction was estimated by comparing forecasted versus observed events, overall and by sex, age and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: The incidence rates per 100 000 person-months of anxiety and depressive disorders were 151.1 (95% CI 150.3 to 152.0) and 32.3 (31.9 to 32.6), respectively, during the prelockdown period. We observed an increase of 37.1% (95% prediction interval 25.5 to 50.2) in incident anxiety diagnoses compared with the expected in March 2020, followed by a reduction of 15.8% (7.3 to 23.5) during the postlockdown period. A reduction in incident depressive disorders occurred during the lockdown and postlockdown periods (45.6% (39.2 to 51.0) and 22.0% (12.6 to 30.1), respectively). Reductions were higher among women during the lockdown period, adults aged 18-34 years and individuals living in the most deprived areas.

Due to regulations for protecting patients' privacy, sensitive individual patient data (IPD) typically cannot be shared across sites.

This algorithm achieves results identical to those achieved using pooled IPD from multiple sites (i.e., the same effect size and standard error estimates), hence demonstrating the lossless property. The algorithm requires each site to contribute minimal aggregated data in only one round of communication. We demonstrate the lossless property of the proposed DLMM algorithm by investigating the associations between demographic and clinical characteristics and length of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients using administrative claims from the UnitedHealth Group Clinical Discovery Database.

Data are lacking on clinical use patterns of dual combination therapies prescribed to patients who escalate from monotherapy. Objective: To investigate the most common dual combinations prescribed for treatment escalation in different countries and how treatment use varies by age, sex, and history of cardiovascular disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from 11 electronic health record databases that cover 118 million patients across 8 countries and regions between January 2000 and December 2019. Included participants were adult patients (ages >/=18 years) who newly initiated antihypertensive dual combination therapy after escalating from monotherapy. There were 2 databases included for 3 countries: the Iqvia Longitudinal Patient Database (LPD) Australia and Electronic Practice-based Research Network 2019 linked data set from South Western Sydney Local Health District (ePBRN SWSLHD) from Australia, Ajou University School of Medicine (AUSOM) and Kyung Hee University Hospital (KHMC) databases from South Korea, and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) and National University Hospital (NUH) databases from Singapore. Data were analyzed from June 2020 through August 2021. Exposures: Treatment with dual combinations of the 4 most commonly used antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI] or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]; calcium channel blocker [CCB]; beta-blocker; and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic). Main Outcomes and Measures: The proportion of patients receiving each dual combination regimen, overall and by country and demographic subgroup. Results: Among 970335 patients with hypertension who newly initiated dual combination therapy included in the final analysis, there were 11494 patients from Australia (including 9291 patients in Australia LPD and 2203 patients in ePBRN SWSLHD), 6980 patients from South Korea (including 6029 patients in Ajou University and 951 patients in KHMC), 2096 patients from Singapore (including 842 patients in KTPH and 1254 patients in NUH), 7008 patients from China, 8544 patients from Taiwan, 103994 patients from France, 76082 patients from Italy, and 754137 patients from the US. The mean (SD) age ranged from 57.6 (14.8) years in China to 67.7 (15.9) years in the Singapore KTPH database, and the proportion of patients by sex ranged from 24358 (36.9%) women in Italy to 408964 (54.3%) women in the US. Among 12 dual combinations of antihypertensive drug classes commonly used, there were significant variations in use across country and patient subgroup. For example starting an ACEI or ARB monotherapy followed by a CCB (ie, ACEI or ARB + CCB) was the most commonly prescribed combination in Australia (698 patients in ePBRN SWSLHD [31.7%] and 3842 patients in Australia LPD [41.4%]) and Singapore (216 patients in KTPH [25.7%] and 439 patients in NUH [35.0%]), while in South Korea, CCB + ACEI or ARB (191 patients in KHMC [20.1%] and 1487 patients in Ajou University [24.7%]), CCB + beta-blocker (814 patients in Ajou University [13.5%] and 217 patients in KHMC [22.8%]), and ACEI or ARB + CCB (147 patients in KHMC [15.5%] and 1216 patients in Ajou University [20.2%]) were the 3 most commonly prescribed combinations. The distribution of 12 dual combination therapies were significantly different by age and sex in almost all databases. For example, use of ACEI or ARB + CCB varied from 873 of 3737 patients ages 18 to 64 years (23.4%) to 343 of 2292 patients ages 65 years or older (15.0%) in South Korea's Ajou University database (P for database distribution by age < .001), while use of ACEI or ARB + CCB varied from 2121 of 4718 (44.8%) men to 1721 of 4549 (37.7%) women in Australian LPD (P for drug combination distributions by sex < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, large variation in the transition between monotherapy and dual combination therapy for hypertension was observed across countries and by demographic group. These findings suggest that future research may be needed to investigate what dual combinations are associated with best outcomes for which patients.", "meshT": "['Adolescent', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', '*Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Hypertension/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thiazides/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']", "source": "JAMA Netw Open. 2022 Mar 1;5(3):e223877. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.3877.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Yuan Lu' 'Mui Van Zandt' 'Yun Liu' 'Jing Li' 'Xialin Wang' 'Yong Chen' 'Zhengfeng Chen' 'Jaehyeong Cho' 'Sreemanee Raaj Dorajoo' 'Mengling Feng' 'Min-Huei Hsu' 'Jason C Hsu' 'Usman Iqbal' 'Jitendra Jonnagaddala' 'Yu-Chuan Li' 'Siaw-Teng Liaw' 'Hong-Seok Lim' 'Kee Yuan Ngiam' 'Phung-Anh Nguyen' 'Rae Woong Park' 'Nicole Pratt' 'Christian Reich' 'Sang Youl Rhee' 'Selva Muthu Kumaran Sathappan' 'Seo Jeong Shin' 'Hui Xing Tan' 'Seng Chan You' 'Xin Zhang' 'Harlan M Krumholz' 'Marc A Suchard' 'Hua Xu'", "firstAuthor": "'Yuan Lu", "pubYear": 2022, "titleAuthorStr": "Analysis of Dual Combination Therapies Used in Treatment of Hypertension in a Multinational Cohort.

The purpose of this study was to use electronic health record (EHR) data to replicate self-reported survey findings from the general US population and assess whether sexual orientation is associated with diagnosed physical health conditions that may elevate risk of COVID-19 severity among veterans who utilize the VA. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of VA EHR data from January 10, 1999-January 07, 2019 analyzed in 2021. Veterans with minoritized sexual orientations were included if they had documentation of a minoritized sexual orientation within clinical notes identified via natural language processing. Veterans without minoritized sexual orientation documentation comprised the comparison group. Adjusted prevalence and prevalence ratios (aPR) were calculated overall and by race/ethnicity while accounting for differences in distributions of sex assigned at birth, age, calendar year of first VA visit, volumes of healthcare utilization, and VA priority group. RESULTS: Data from 108,401 veterans with minoritized sexual orientation and 6,511,698 controls were analyzed. After adjustment, veterans with minoritized sexual orientations had a statistically significant elevated prevalence of 10 of the 11 conditions. Amongst the highest disparities observed were COPD (aPR:1.24 [95% confidence interval:1.23-1.26]), asthma (1.22 [1.20-1.24]), and stroke (1.26 [1.24-1.28]). CONCLUSIONS: Findings largely corroborated patterns among the general US population. Further research is needed to determine if these disparities translate to poorer COVID-19 outcomes for individuals with minoritized sexual orientation.", "meshT": "['Bisexuality', '*COVID-19/epidemiology', 'Female', '*Homosexuality, Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sexual Behavior', 'United States/epidemiology', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', '*Veterans']", "source": "Ann Epidemiol. 2022 Feb;66:5-12. doi: 10.1016/j.annepidem.2021.11.006.

We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Data Enclave, a harmonized electronic health record (EHR) dataset of 5.9 million nationally-representative, diverse, and gender-balanced patients, to describe outcomes in patients with CLD and cirrhosis with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We identified all chronic liver diseases patients with and without cirrhosis who had SARS-CoV-2 testing documented in the N3C Data Enclave as of data release date 5/15/2021. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Survival analysis methods were used to estimate cumulative incidences of death, hospitalization, and mechanical ventilation, and to calculate the associations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, presence of cirrhosis, and demographic and clinical factors to 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We isolated 217,143 patients with CLD: 129,097 (59%) without cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 negative, 25,844 (12%) without cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 positive, 54,065 (25%) with cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 negative, and 8,137 (4%) with cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 positive. Among CLD patients without cirrhosis, 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 0.4% in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients and 1.8% in positive patients. Among CLD patients with cirrhosis, 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 4.0% in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients and 9.7% in positive patients.Compared to those who tested SARS-CoV-2 negative, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was associated with more than two-fold (aHR 2.43, 95% CI 2.23-2.64) hazard of death at 30 days among patients with cirrhosis. Compared to patients without cirrhosis, the presence of cirrhosis was associated with a three-fold (aHR 3.39, 95% CI 2.96-3.89) hazard of death at 30 days among patients who tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. Age (aHR 1.03 per year, 95% CI 1.03-1.04) was associated with death at 30 days among patients with cirrhosis who were SARS-CoV-2 positive. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of nearly 220,000 CLD patients, we found SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cirrhosis was associated with 2.43-times mortality hazard, and the presence of cirrhosis among CLD patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were associated with 3.39-times mortality hazard.

METHODS: This study was a retrospective observational cohort study that used data based on insurance benefit claims sent to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea by May 15, 2020. These claims comprised all Covid-19 tested cases and the history of medical service use in these patients for the past five years. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the rate of ventilator care was compared between the groups. RESULTS: From a total of 7,590 patients diagnosed with Covid-19, two distinct cohorts were generated based on RAAS inhibitors prescribed within 6 months before Covid-19 diagnosis. A total of 1,111 patients was prescribed RAAS inhibitors, and 794 patients were prescribed antihypertensive drugs, excluding RAAS inhibitors. In propensity-score matched analysis, 666 pairs of data set were generated, and all-cause mortality of the RAAS inhibitor group showed no significant difference compared with the non-RAAS inhibitor group (14.6% vs. 11.1%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-1.15; p = 0.22).

Existing published DQ terms were harmonized to a comprehensive unified terminology with definitions and examples and organized into a conceptual framework to support a common approach to defining whether EHR data is 'fit' for specific uses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DQ publications, informatics and analytics experts, managers of established DQ programs, and operational manuals from several mature EHR-based research networks were reviewed to identify potential DQ terms and categories. Two face-to-face stakeholder meetings were used to vet an initial set of DQ terms and definitions that were grouped into an overall conceptual framework. Feedback received from data producers and users was used to construct a draft set of harmonized DQ terms and categories. Multiple rounds of iterative refinement resulted in a set of terms and organizing framework consisting of DQ categories, subcategories, terms, definitions, and examples. The harmonized terminology and logical framework's inclusiveness was evaluated against ten published DQ terminologies. RESULTS: Existing DQ terms were harmonized and organized into a framework by defining three DQ categories: (1) Conformance (2) Completeness and (3) Plausibility and two DQ assessment contexts: (1) Verification and (2) Validation. Conformance and Plausibility categories were further divided into subcategories. Each category and subcategory was defined with respect to whether the data may be verified with organizational data, or validated against an accepted gold standard, depending on proposed context and uses. The coverage of the harmonized DQ terminology was validated by successfully aligning to multiple published DQ terminologies. DISCUSSION: Existing DQ concepts, community input, and expert review informed the development of a distinct set of terms, organized into categories and subcategories. The resulting DQ terms successfully encompassed a wide range of disparate DQ terminologies. Operational definitions were developed to provide guidance for implementing DQ assessment procedures. The resulting structure is an inclusive DQ framework for standardizing DQ assessment and reporting. While our analysis focused on the DQ issues often found in EHR data, the new terminology may be applicable to a wide range of electronic health data such as administrative, research, and patient-reported data. CONCLUSION: A consistent, common DQ terminology, organized into a logical framework, is an initial step in enabling data owners and users, patients, and policy makers to evaluate and communicate data quality findings in a well-defined manner with a shared vocabulary. Future work will leverage the framework and terminology to develop reusable data quality assessment and reporting methods.", "meshT": "nan", "source": "EGEMS (Wash DC). 2016 Sep 11;4(1):1244. doi: 10.13063/2327-9214.1244. eCollection 2016.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Michael G Kahn' 'Tiffany J Callahan' 'Juliana Barnard' 'Alan E Bauck' 'Jeff Brown' 'Bruce N Davidson' 'Hossein Estiri' 'Carsten Goerg' 'Erin Holve' 'Steven G Johnson' 'Siaw-Teng Liaw' 'Marianne Hamilton-Lopez' 'Daniella Meeker' 'Toan C Ong' 'Patrick Ryan' 'Ning Shang' 'Nicole G Weiskopf' 'Chunhua Weng' 'Meredith N Zozus' 'Lisa Schilling'", "firstAuthor": "'Michael G Kahn", "pubYear": 2016, "titleAuthorStr": "A Harmonized Data Quality Assessment Terminology and Framework for the Secondary Use of Electronic Health Record Data.

There are no readily available risk scores that can accurately identify which patients are most likely to sustain an event, making it difficult to identify those who might benefit from more aggressive intervention. Thus, we aimed to develop a novel predictive model-using machine learning methods on electronic health record data-to identify which PAD patients are most likely to develop major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were derived from patients diagnosed with PAD at 2 tertiary care institutions. Predictive models were built using a common data model that allowed for utilization of both structured (coded) and unstructured (text) data. Only data from time of entry into the health system up to PAD diagnosis were used for modeling. Models were developed and tested using nested cross-validation. A total of 7686 patients were included in learning our predictive models. Utilizing almost 1000 variables, our best predictive model accurately determined which PAD patients would go on to develop major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events with an area under the curve of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.80-0.83). CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithms applied to data in the electronic health record can learn models that accurately identify PAD patients at risk of future major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, highlighting the great potential of electronic health records to provide automated risk stratification for cardiovascular diseases. Common data models that can enable cross-institution research and technology development could potentially be an important aspect of widespread adoption of newer risk-stratification models.", "meshT": "['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology', '*Data Mining', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Humans', '*Machine Learning', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Arterial Disease/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']", "source": "Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2019 Mar;12(3):e004741. doi: 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.118.004741.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Elsie Gyang Ross' 'Kenneth Jung' 'Joel T Dudley' 'Li Li' 'Nicholas J Leeper' 'Nigam H Shah'", "firstAuthor": "'Elsie Gyang Ross", "pubYear": 2019, "titleAuthorStr": "Predicting Future Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease Using Electronic Health Record Data.

This problem is paramount in medicine, where we would like to answer causal questions from large observational datasets like electronic health records (EHRs) and administrative claims. Modern medical data typically contain tens of thousands of covariates. Such a large set carries hope that many of the confounders are directly measured, and further hope that others are indirectly measured through their correlation with measured covariates. How can we exploit these large sets of covariates for causal inference? To help answer this question, this paper examines the performance of the large-scale propensity score (LSPS) approach on causal analysis of medical data. We demonstrate that LSPS may adjust for indirectly measured confounders by including tens of thousands of covariates that may be correlated with them. We present conditions under which LSPS removes bias due to indirectly measured confounders, and we show that LSPS may avoid bias when inadvertently adjusting for variables (like colliders) that otherwise can induce bias. We demonstrate the performance of LSPS with both simulated medical data and real medical data.", "meshT": "['Bias', 'Causality', '*Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Propensity Score']", "source": "J Biomed Inform. 2022 Oct;134:104204. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2022.104204.

OBJECTIVE: To examine multinational trends in antipsychotic drug prescribing for people living with dementia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multinational network cohort study used electronic health records and claims data from 8 databases in 6 countries (France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, the UK, and the US) for individuals aged 65 years or older between January 1, 2016, and November 30, 2021. Two databases each were included for South Korea and the US. EXPOSURES: The introduction of population-wide COVID-19 restrictions from April 2020 to the latest available date of each database. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were yearly and monthly incidence of dementia diagnosis and prevalence of people living with dementia who were prescribed antipsychotic drugs in each database. Interrupted time series analyses were used to quantify changes in prescribing rates before and after the introduction of population-wide COVID-19 restrictions. RESULTS: A total of 857\u202f238 people with dementia aged 65 years or older (58.0% female) were identified in 2016. Reductions in the incidence of dementia were observed in 7 databases in the early phase of the pandemic (April, May, and June 2020), with the most pronounced reduction observed in 1 of the 2 US databases (rate ratio [RR], 0.30; 95% CI, 0.27-0.32); reductions were also observed in the total number of people with dementia prescribed antipsychotic drugs in France, Italy, South Korea, the UK, and the US. Rates of antipsychotic drug prescribing for people with dementia increased in 6 databases representing all countries. Compared with the corresponding month in 2019, the most pronounced increase in 2020 was observed in May in South Korea (Kangwon National University database) (RR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.47-3.02) and June in the UK (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.24-3.09). The rates of antipsychotic drug prescribing in these 6 databases remained high in 2021. Interrupted time series analyses revealed immediate increases in the prescribing rate in Italy (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08-1.58) and in the US Medicare database (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20-1.71) after the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found converging evidence that the rate of antipsychotic drug prescribing to people with dementia increased in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the 6 countries studied and did not decrease to prepandemic levels after the acute phase of the pandemic had ended. These findings suggest that the pandemic disrupted the care of people living with dementia and that the development of intervention strategies is needed to ensure the quality of care.", "meshT": "None", "source": "JAMA Psychiatry. 2023 Jan 25. doi: 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.4448.", "fullAuthorEdited": "'Hao Luo' 'Wallis C Y Lau' 'Yi Chai' 'Carmen Olga Torre' 'Robert Howard' 'Kathy Y Liu' 'Xiaoyu Lin' 'Can Yin' 'Stephen Fortin' 'David M Kern' 'Dong Yun Lee' 'Rae Woong Park' 'Jae-Won Jang' 'Celine S L Chui' 'Jing Li' 'Christian Reich' 'Kenneth K C Man' 'Ian C K Wong'", "firstAuthor": "'Hao Luo", "pubYear": 2023, "titleAuthorStr": "Rates of Antipsychotic Drug Prescribing Among People Living With Dementia During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
